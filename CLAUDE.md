# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Patterns shared across every Mediashock internal tool (notifications, theme toggle, icons,
> auth, Firestore rules gotchas) live in `CLAUDE.md` in the parent `Claude Projects/` folder —
> check there before building something this project's own architecture below doesn't cover.

## What this is

**Name: "Project Manager"** (renamed from "Flowboard" on 2026-10-05, on request). Use "Project
Manager" in anything the team reads — UI text, the New Updates changelog, toasts, notifications,
export file names. "Flowboard" still appears in older notes below, in code identifiers, in the
emulator project id (`demo-flowboard`) and in every `localStorage` key (`flowboard_*`). **Leave the
keys alone**: renaming them would silently reset everyone's saved filters, sidebar state, chat
width, teamspace and read-tracking on their next visit.

Project Manager — a shared kanban/task-prioritization board for Mediashock APAC, built as a single
client-side HTML file (no build step, no framework, no bundler), backed by Firebase (Firestore +
Google Auth) so the whole team edits one live board together with real-time updates.

- **`index.html`** (~3300 lines) — the entire app: markup, Tailwind styling, and vanilla ES-module
  JS in one file. This is virtually the whole codebase.
- `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules` — Firebase CLI project files
  for `pscr-project-manager`. Chat image sharing (see below) needs this project on the **Blaze**
  (pay-as-you-go) plan with Cloud Storage enabled — Firestore usage alone would still fit inside
  Spark's free tier, and everything else in this app assumed Spark until that feature shipped.
  **As of 2026-10-07 the project is still on Spark** (the upgrade was never done), so image
  sharing is switched off with `CHAT_IMAGES_ENABLED = false`; see "Chat image sharing".
- `sw.js` — a no-op service worker (exists only to satisfy PWA installability; deliberately does
  no caching, see comment in the file).
- `version.txt` — a timestamp stamped on every deploy; polled client-side to trigger auto-reload.

Views: Board, Timeline (Gantt), Calendar, People, Projects, Chat, **Events → WIP Meeting**, **Monday Meeting**,
Activity, Suggestions, Archived, **New Updates**.

Live at https://mediashock-apac.github.io/ms-project-manager/ (deployed via GitHub Pages, not Firebase
Hosting — `firebase.json` only configures Firestore + emulators).

## Standing design rule: count the clutter, not just the feature

**Every UI change here is judged on the visual noise it adds, not only on whether it works.**
Stated directly: *"make sure moving forward that all designs should take visual clutter into
consideration."* This is a bar to clear before shipping, not a nice-to-have.

The reason is specific to this app: a handful of people look at it all day. A control that
technically works but adds noise costs attention on *every* visit, while the feature behind it
might be used weekly. Clutter has been reported here repeatedly, and **in every single case the
fix was to remove or relocate something, never to add**:

| Reported | Fix |
|---|---|
| Timeline priority dots | Deleted — the bar already painted that colour |
| Departments row on every People card | Moved to the profile menu |
| People card header | Split into identity and workload lines |
| Per-project teamspace filing | Deleted; departments derived from assignees instead |
| Task name inside every Timeline bar | Deleted — the frozen label column already carries it |
| Folder name clipped in WIP Meeting rows | Split onto its own line, where it wraps in full |
| Priority dot on Board rows | Deleted -- the priority badge on the same row already says it |

Concrete checks, each learned from one of the above:

- **Before adding to an existing row, ask what that surface is FOR.** The People header packed
  identity chips into a row already carrying workload counts — two unlike kinds of fact at equal
  weight, so neither could be scanned. The Board card's metadata row had already made and fixed
  the same mistake. Unlike groups need separate lines, not more `gap`.
- **Variable-width chips destroy the scannability of anything after them.** Numbers meant to be
  compared down a column must start at the same x on every card.
- **Don't render a control for a value most rows will never set.** Progressive disclosure is the
  established pattern (`+ Time off`, `+ Deadline`); a permanently-open form on every card reads
  as something you are required to fill in.
- **A set-once preference about yourself belongs in the profile menu**, not repeated on every
  person's card.
- **Prefer deriving over asking.** Project departments are computed from assignees: less UI, less
  state, nothing to maintain, and it cannot drift out of date.
- **Removing a redundant signal is a real fix**, not a cop-out. If a value is already visible
  somewhere on the same row, a second rendering of it is noise.
- **Amber has a light-mode floor: fills `amber-100` (never `amber-50`), text `amber-700`+ on
  white and `amber-800` on an amber fill, borders `amber-300`.** Reported as "pale yellow is hard
  to see": `amber-50` barely separates from the near-white page, and `amber-600` text is ~3.2:1
  (below the 4.5:1 minimum for small text). Every light-mode amber was raised in one pass; dark
  mode was left as it was. The only exception is Chat's gold favourite star (`text-amber-500`),
  a filled icon, not text.
- **Two chips must never carry the same word.** "Admin" the department and "Admin" the role were
  briefly both on one card; the role became "Admin rights".

## Standing rule: the tool must not add work

Stated directly (2026-10-07): *"this PM tool should not add more work to people. It should be easy
to use, accurate and fuss free. Make this a rule."* Check every change against it, next to the
clutter rule above:

- **Ask "what new work does this create, and for whom?"** If any, cut it, or it must replace
  something people already do (a sheet, a chase, a Doc).
- **Never ask for the same information twice.** A Friday "add a status line to each task" nudge
  was built and dropped before shipping: the Monday update already covers status per project.
- **Reminders: one per person per event, only when there's something to do, never repeated.**
  Count only real signals, so a nudge is never wrong (an admin editing someone else's task is not
  asked to log time on it).
- **Derive rather than ask; default rather than choose.**

## Standing rule: every feature works together, in sync

Stated directly (2026-10-07): *"Make sure all the features in the PM tool work together
syncronisingly and not in separately"*, then *"make this a rule"*. For every change:

- **One fact, one place.** Every view reads it from there or derives it; never a second copy that
  has to be kept in step by hand (the Monday "on leave" tick reads and writes booked leave).
- **Same action, same side effects, wherever it's done**: desktop, phone, Board drag, WIP, brief,
  import. Status effects, notifications, activity log, ids.
- **Live everywhere, open windows included** (task window, brief card, pop-ups), and never write
  back a stale copy over someone else's change.
- **Shared rules come from shared helpers**: `dueUrgency` for overdue, `stepIsLate` for a late
  step, `taskTimeMinutes` for time.
- **Names used as links survive renames and case/spacing variants** (`canonicalProjectName`,
  the project doc follows a renamed project).
- Before building, list what else reads or writes the same data and wire it in the same change.

## Standing rule: learn from the reference tools

Stated directly (2026-10-08): *"always take references from these tools when building new features and
giving recommendations"* (TeamGantt, Monday, Notion and equivalents: Asana, Linear, Basecamp, ClickUp,
Slack for chat). Before proposing or building, check how they handle it (search when unsure or when
recency matters), name the source in the proposal and in the note here, then filter it through the two
rules above and the clutter rule. Borrow the mechanic, not the product: things already built and removed
here (dependencies, Gantt grouping, the progress column) stay out even when a reference tool has them.

## Commands

**Browser tests: `node tests/run.mjs`** (see `tests/README.md`). 17 suites, ~265 checks, each loading
the real `index.html` in Chromium with Firebase replaced by `tests/fbstub.js`. They run on every push to
`main` and every weekday at 7am Singapore (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`); a failure is a red X plus
GitHub's email. Asked for directly: "Constantly run checks as I did today to make sure everything is
tight and functioning as it should be." **Change or add a suite in the same commit as the feature**, and
when a New Updates item gets a `tourTarget`, add its `cl-<id>` to every suite's `toursSeen` seed.
Locally, don't `npm install` into this Shared Drive folder; point `NODE_PATH` at a `node_modules` with
Playwright 1.63.

There is no build or lint tooling; it's static HTML/JS served as-is. Local development uses the
Firebase Local Emulator Suite (Auth + Firestore + Storage):

```
firebase emulators:start --project demo-flowboard
python -m http.server 8765   # serve over http://, not file:// — Auth popup sign-in requires a real origin
```

The app auto-detects `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` (`USE_EMULATORS` in index.html) and points itself at
the emulators instead of the real Firebase project — no config changes needed to switch.

## Deploying

There's no CI/deploy script in this repo. When shipping a change to `index.html`, bump both to
**the same** timestamp:
- `CURRENT_BUILD_VERSION` (near the bottom of the module script in `index.html`)
- `version.txt`

**Bumping only one of them puts every client into a reload loop**, and `check-syntax.mjs` now
fails on the mismatch for that reason. The client reloads whenever `version.txt` differs from the
constant baked into the page it is running — so if they drift, that is still true after the
reload, and it never converges: a reload every 5s (`reloadIfPendingAndSafe`) and one on every
`visibilitychange`. It has shipped once, from bumping `version.txt` alone, and it reached the
team as *"why does the notification popup again each time I minimize and maximize the desktop
app?"* — the visibilitychange half of the loop, reported by its most visible symptom rather than
as "the app is reloading", which is what it actually was.

**Syntax-check before shipping.** There's no build step, so nothing catches a broken `<script>` —
and because it's one big `type="module"`, a single syntax error anywhere kills the *entire* app,
not just the feature that introduced it. This has already shipped once: commit `7ca02d4` landed a
literal `&amp;&amp;` (HTML-escaped `&&`) inside `addDependency()`, which made the whole module fail
to parse and took the live board down completely.

`scripts/check-syntax.mjs` now guards this — it extracts every inline `<script>` in `index.html`
(currently 3, not just the big module one) and runs `node --check` over each, reporting failures
against `index.html`'s own line numbers:

```
node scripts/check-syntax.mjs
```

It's wired in two places, because neither alone is enough:

- **`.githooks/pre-push`** actually *prevents* the bad deploy. It needs one command per clone:
  ```
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks
  ```
  Git hooks aren't distributed by `git clone`, so a fresh checkout has no protection until
  someone runs that. `git push --no-verify` bypasses it deliberately.
- **`.github/workflows/syntax-check.yml`** is the backstop for pushes where the hook wasn't
  enabled, was bypassed, or the edit came from the GitHub web UI. It runs *after* the push, so it
  can only make the breakage loud (red X) rather than stop it — GitHub Pages will already have
  deployed. Turning this into a real gate would mean moving Pages off its branch-based build onto
  an Actions-based deploy that only publishes when the check passes; that's a bigger change and
  hasn't been done.

Both paths run the same script, so there's one place to fix if the markup ever changes shape.

**Add a `CHANGELOG` entry for anything the team would notice** (see "New Updates" below). A
release nobody wrote up never lights the sidebar item, so the team never hears about it.

## Guided tours (onboarding + new features)

Asked for directly: a tutorial that walks new users through the platform, short tours that
introduce new major features, easy to follow, not long, and skippable. Then, right after: **"the
tutorial should auto update on new features"** — so feature tours are generated, not hand-written.

- **One engine, in-house** (`TOURS`, `startTour`, `renderTourStep`, `positionTourStep` in
  index.html, next to `CHANGELOG`). A spotlight box whose huge spread `box-shadow` dims everything
  else, plus a card with "N of M", progress dots, Back / Next (Done, or "Got it" on a one-step
  tour) and Skip tour. Escape skips, arrow keys step, Tab stays in the card. No library — same
  single-file rule as everything else here.
- **Welcome tour: 7 steps, under a minute, in ONE sweep across the screen** (2026-10-08, reported:
  "It feels like it jumps all over the place"; it had grown to 10 steps that crossed the screen at
  almost every step). Order: welcome (centred) → Add Task → bell → search + Ctrl K (the top bar,
  right to left) → Focus of the Day (below) → teamspace and the pages list as ONE step → profile menu
  (bottom of the sidebar). Tour guidance (Appcues, Userpilot, Intercom) and Notion's own tour: 3-7
  steps, in reading order, no doubling back. **A new step goes where it sits on screen in that
  sweep, never at the end**; neighbouring controls share a step (`target` takes a selector list,
  "#a, #b", and `tourTargetRect` spotlights the union). The spotlight glides 0.35s ease-in-out so the
  eye can follow it. `tests/tour-welcome.test.js` checks the route.
- **Who sees what is decided by the account's creation time** (`auth.currentUser.metadata.
  creationTime`, i.e. first sign-in), so nobody is asked anything:
  - welcome: accounts created on/after `TOURS_LAUNCH` (2026-10-06). Teammates already using the
    app when tours shipped don't get a beginner tour; they got the one-step `tours-intro` instead.
  - a feature tour: accounts created *before* its date, and only within `FEATURE_TOUR_AUTO_DAYS`
    (60) of it, oldest first, **one per visit** — several features never arrive as one long tour.
  - starting the welcome tour marks every tour seen, so a new joiner never gets a queue.
- **Auto-updating: give a `CHANGELOG` item a `tourTarget`** (a CSS selector) and that release
  becomes feature tour `cl-<release id>` (one step per targeted item, the item's own title and
  text) and gets a "Show me" on New Updates. **It is no longer folded into the welcome tour**
  (`WELCOME_FEATURE_MAX` = 0 since 2026-10-08; the code path stays): folded items made the tour
  long, pointed wherever each feature sat, and "A more useful Calendar" means nothing to someone new.
  New joiners meet newer features through the page tours; one basic enough for day one gets a step
  written into the welcome sweep by hand (Ctrl K did). **Use `tourTarget` only for a major feature
  someone could miss**, and only on something visible from any view (sidebar, header, toolbar):
  the tour does not switch views. Small fixes stay plain notes.
- **Read tracking**: `people/{uid}.toursSeen` (array; your own doc, so no rules change) plus
  `localStorage` `flowboard_tours_seen`; the union counts. Marked seen when a tour *starts*, so a
  reload mid-tour doesn't replay it.
- **Timing**: `maybeStartTour()` runs from the `people` snapshot right after
  `maybePromptDepartment()`, waits for your own roster row (so a tour seen on another device isn't
  replayed before `toursSeen` arrives), and retries every 3s while any modal is open or you are
  typing — the department prompt always goes first.
- **A missing or off-screen target falls back to a centred card** (e.g. sidebar steps on a phone,
  where the sidebar is an off-canvas drawer), so a step never points at nothing.
- **Replay**: profile menu → "Take the tour", or "Show me" on a New Updates item.
- **Voice: conversational and friendly** (asked for directly). Talk to one person, use
  contractions, open with a question where it fits ("Not sure where to begin?"), still one or two
  short sentences. No emoji (the icon rule). Tour strings are double-quoted so apostrophes need no
  escaping — single-quoted strings with a bare `'` have broken the syntax check twice this week.
  A step can set `cta` to replace the Next/Done label ("Show me around", "Let's go!").
- **Product illustrations (`TOUR_ART`) on the welcome tour's first and last cards only. Fourth
  design: don't walk it back.** Drawn the way Linear/Notion/Stripe draw them: one bold branded
  backdrop (a Poppy-to-indigo gradient, blurred colour orbs, a fine dot texture), real-looking UI
  cards floating in layers at different angles with soft shadows, a hero moment, floating chips,
  and motion (a dashed swoosh, sparkles, confetti).
  - **Welcome:** a tilted task card with a checklist, two items ticked and a cursor mid-click on
    the third; a timeline card behind it; a "done" pill, a typing chat bubble and team avatars.
  - **All set:** a white medallion with a Poppy tick inside rings, a fully ticked mini task card, a
    cheering chat bubble with the team, and a confetti burst.
  - No labels. The picture shows the tool being used, and the card text says what it is for. Every
    element is still a real part of the app, so it explains as well as delights.
  - **History, so nobody repeats it:** (1) hand-drawn stick figures, changed to "graphics instead";
    (2) abstract gradient shapes, which prompted "what does the orange circle mean?" (it meant
    nothing); (3) a labelled Plan/Track/Talk/Done road, judged "not fun nor creative. Give me
    something that a designer would create." It read as a flowchart: labels, dotted stems, evenly
    spaced stops.
  - **Colours:** Mediashock's, from MS Creatives' `BRAND`/`BUCKET_COLORS`. Poppy `#ff4e20` leads,
    with indigo `#6366f1` and cyan `#0891b2` in support. No amber: it means Medium priority here.
  - The art is a self-contained coloured panel, so it needs no dark-mode variant. Ids are prefixed
    per graphic (`ta-w-*`, `ta-d-*`).
  - Bookends only, by agreement: those two cards point at nothing, so a graphic adds warmth there,
    whereas one on every step would compete with the spotlight and make the tour feel longer. A
    step opts in with `art: '<key>'`.
- **Page tours** (`PAGE_TOURS`, `maybeStartPageTour`, asked for next: "guided tours should also be
  applied to other pages when new users click into it. When new pages are added, existing users
  should also be able to go through the tour"). One 1–2 step tour per view, seen as `page:<view>`.
  - New joiners get each page's tour on their first visit. Existing teammates only get a page
    whose `since` is after their account was created — **so a new page ships with
    `since: '<ship date>'` and every existing teammate is toured through it on first visit.**
    Pages that predate tours use `PAGE_TOURS_EXISTING` (2026-01-01, before every account).
  - Fires from `setView` only, so never on the page you land on at sign-in (that's the welcome
    tour's moment), and never while the welcome or a feature tour is due or running — tours
    never stack.
  - **What a page tour is for: the things a newcomer would NOT find alone** (hidden or non-obvious
    actions), not a description of everything. Asked "the guided tour for other pages seem really brief. Is
    it enough?": the simple pages were fine at 1-2 steps; four were extended, still capped at 3 steps:
    Timeline (+ what the warning marks mean, via `#gantt-legend`; resizing the Task column in the text),
    Projects (+ "+ Brief"; deadline and Ready to archive in the text), WIP (+ Needs a decision and the
    project list with the ⋯ category menu, status updates and "+ Add entry"; the range picker folded into
    step 1), Chat (@mentions, pasting screenshots and pinning in the text, since a message only exists
    once a chat is open). Something that cannot be pointed at goes into a nearby step's text.
  - **"Show me" on a New Updates item about a page opens that page and plays its page tour** (asked: "Show me
    should go to the page itself"). An item counts as "about a page" when its `tourTarget` is that page's
    sidebar link (`[data-view-btn="x"]`) and `PAGE_TOURS[x]` exists (`data-show-view`). Other items keep their
    spotlight tour (e.g. Guided tours plays the welcome tour). The automatic what's-new popup is unchanged.
  - **Existing teammates never see page tours for existing pages**, so a new feature on an existing page
    also needs a what's-new tour: briefs got one via `tourTarget` on its CHANGELOG item.
  - Replay: profile menu → "Tour this page". Targets are each view's own containers/controls;
    `#calendar-scope-toggle`, `#wip-mode-toggle` and `#wip-range-toggle` ids exist for this. An
    empty container (zero height, e.g. an empty archive) falls back to a centred card.
  - Verified in Chromium (53 checks: every page's every step highlighted with the card on screen,
    no repeat on second visit, no stacking on a due welcome tour, existing users skip old pages
    but get a newer one, replay).
- Verified in Chromium against the real markup with Firebase stubbed (24 checks: who gets which
  tour, every step's card on screen at 1440×900, auto-derived tour and welcome folding, mobile
  fallback, Escape/Skip, waits for a modal). Not yet clicked through signed in on the live app.

## New Updates (the changelog tab)

Asked for directly: a sidebar tab with "a simple to understand changelog of features that are
newly created or updated, bug fixes and more", which "should highlight prominently on the
sidebar so users will know whenever new updates are in."

- **The content is a hand-written `CHANGELOG` array in `index.html`**, newest release first:
  `{id, date, items: [{type: 'new'|'improved'|'fixed', title, text}]}`. Plain language for the
  people using the board: what changed and where to find it, never function names. It is static
  on purpose — no Firestore collection, no admin editor, no rules change — because the person
  shipping the change is the one who knows what changed, and they are already editing this file.
  `id` must be unique and is the read-tracking key (date plus a letter for a second release that
  day). Not generated from git log: commit messages are written for whoever maintains the code.
- **Read tracking**: `people/{uid}.updatesSeen` (last release id seen, follows you across devices,
  no rules change since it's your own doc) mirrored to `localStorage` (`flowboard_updates_seen`);
  whichever is newer wins, because the roster snapshot may not have arrived yet. Unread = every
  release above the seen one. **Someone who has never opened the tab gets only the newest release
  counted**, so the first visit doesn't show the whole history as "new".
- **Sidebar highlight** (`renderUpdatesNavBadge`, called from `renderCurrentSecondaryView`): while
  anything is unread the item gets a brand tint (`.updates-unread`) and a pulsing brand-orange
  count (`#updates-nav-badge`, `.updates-pulse`, off under reduced motion). The count is
  absolute like Chat's, so it still shows on the collapsed rail. Orange, not Chat's rose, so the
  two badges don't read as the same thing. All of it disappears the moment the tab is opened —
  it's a quiet nav item the rest of the time.
- **Opening the tab** snapshots what was unseen (`updatesUnseenAtOpen`) *before* marking it
  seen, so those releases still carry a "New since your last visit" label and an orange border on
  that visit. Toolbar hidden (`TOOLBAR_FULLY_HIDDEN_VIEWS`) — nothing to search or filter.
- **Rendered one heading and one card per DAY**, not per release (`renderUpdatesView` merges
  consecutive releases with the same `date`) -- several releases a day each repeated the date
  heading, reported as "why aren't updates on the same day grouped together?". Releases stay
  separate in `CHANGELOG` because their ids are the read-tracking keys; "new since your last
  visit" is an orange left edge per item, since one day can mix seen and unseen releases.
- **Rewrite or empty a same-week entry once a later change makes it untrue** rather than leaving
  two entries that contradict each other. Keep the release object (with `items: []`) so its id
  still works for read tracking; an empty release renders nothing.
- **Wide, two items per row from `lg`** (`max-w-6xl`, was `max-w-2xl`): asked for directly, "so
  the scroll down isn't too long when things pile up". Width alone would only make long lines;
  the saving is the grid. Dividers are a 1px grid `gap` over a tinted card background
  (`divide-y` can't draw a grid), and an odd last item spans both columns. **Don't put
  `bg-white` on that same container**: it overrides the tint and the dividers vanish (shipped
  that way for one build).
- **The same "less scrolling" pass, applied to the other narrow pages** (all were `max-w-2xl`):
  - **Archived**: `max-w-6xl`, a two-column grid from `lg`; year headings and the empty state
    span both columns (`lg:col-span-2`).
  - **Suggestions**: `max-w-6xl`, cards in **two independent columns** from `lg`, alternating
    (newest top-left, next top-right). Reply threads make cards very uneven, so a row grid would
    leave gaps. Below `lg` the columns are `display: contents` and each card carries an inline
    `order`, so a phone gets one list in true newest-first order. CSS `columns` was rejected: it
    fills the whole left column first, so the second-newest post could land halfway down the page.
    Accepted trade: alternation can leave one column longer than the other.
  - **Activity**: `max-w-4xl`, **still one column**. It's a log read top to bottom, so two
    columns would scramble its order; search is the real fix for length.
  - Verified in Chromium: 2 columns at 1440px, a single newest-first list at 390px.
- Type chips: New = brand, Improved = violet, Fixed = emerald. Labelled chips on a page with no
  priorities on it, so the usual "these hues mean priority" concern doesn't apply here.
- The seed entries (29 Sep – 5 Oct 2026) were written from that period's commits.

The deployed page polls `version.txt` every 60s and, once it changes, shows a "new version is ready" banner (`#update-banner`: brand orange with a "Refresh now" button, slides up then pulses a soft glow -- the old dark-grey "An update was made, please refresh." bar matched dark-mode cards and was reported as easy to miss) (it no longer reloads by itself; the banner waits until the person stops editing) --- formerly auto-reloaded clients when it changed — but
`reloadIfPendingAndSafe()` will never reload out from under a user with a modal open, so a stale
tab can sit on `pendingBuildVersion` for a while. (That modal guard is also the only reason the
drift loop above is survivable rather than a hard lock-out: anyone mid-edit keeps their draft.)

## Architecture

Everything lives in one `<script type="module">` at the bottom of `index.html`. Rough layout, top
to bottom:

1. **Firebase setup** — `firebaseConfig`/emulator switch, `isAllowedEmail` domain gate.
2. **Notifications** — `parseMentions`/`notifyOnComment`: comments create `notifications` docs for
   the assignee and any `@Name`-mentioned teammates. `notifyAssignment` separately notifies a
   task's assignee on creation or reassignment, even with no comment attached (hooked into the
   task-save handler, gated on `oldTask.assignee !== assignee`). The notification bell shows
   read/unread state visually (dot + bold vs. muted text). The `suggestions` tab (comment/reply on
   a feature-request board, not tied to a task) follows the same embedded-array reply model as
   task comments — see Firestore data model below.
   - **A mention must END where the name ends.** `parseMentions` and `enrichCommentText` both
     append a shared `MENTION_TAIL = '(?![A-Za-z0-9])'` to their generated regex. Without it an
     assignee name that's a prefix of a longer word matched inside it: with "Dee" on the board,
     typing "@Deepak" sent Dee a real mention notification for a comment that never named them, and
     rendered as a half-highlighted "@Dee"+"pak". Sorting names longest-first in `enrichCommentText`
     does *not* cover this -- that only handles one assignee name being a prefix of another, not of
     an arbitrary word. The sibling Content Hub has the identical pair
     (`parseMentions`/`enrichFeedbackText`) and the same constant; all four were fixed together, so
     a change to one needs the same change in the other three.
   - **Comment replies actually thread now** (`renderCommentsLog`, `backfillCommentThreading`,
     `inferReplyTarget`) — reported directly ("why are the replies to comments not just below the
     comment itself?"). Root cause: clicking Reply never created a real reply. It just prefilled
     the new-comment box with `"@Author "` and, once sent, that landed as an ordinary comment
     appended to the same flat array — visually indistinguishable from a top-level comment except
     for the mention text, so there was no actual parent/child relationship for anything to render
     nested from.
     - **Comments still store as a flat array, always appended via `arrayUnion`** — that's
       deliberate and unchanged, since a full reorder would mean rewriting the whole array on
       every add instead of an atomic append, reopening exactly the race-on-concurrent-comment
       risk `arrayUnion` exists to avoid. Threading is purely a render-time concern:
       `renderCommentsLog` walks each comment's new `replyTo` (a parent comment's `id`) into a
       tree and renders replies nested (indented, left-bordered) directly under their parent. A
       `replyTo` pointing at an id no longer present (parent removed) falls back to rendering as a
       top-level comment rather than vanishing or throwing.
     - **New replies get a real `replyTo`, not another guess.** `task-comment-add-btn`'s handler
       now assigns every comment a `uid()` id and, via `inferReplyTarget`, resolves `replyTo`
       against the task's current comments at send time — same function the backfill below uses,
       so live replies and migrated old ones can never drift into different logic.
     - **`backfillCommentThreading(comments)` migrates existing data** — assigns a stable `id` to
       any comment that doesn't have one (same fix-it-forward pattern as the checklist item id
       backfill above it), then infers `replyTo` for comments predating this field via
       `inferReplyTarget`'s heuristic: a comment counts as a reply only when its text *starts with*
       `"@Name "` — exactly what the Reply button always inserted — resolving to the most recent
       *earlier* comment by that name. This can't be certain (a manually-typed leading mention
       with no reply intent looks identical after the fact), but it's the best inference available
       for data written before replies were tracked as a real field.
     - **Unlike the checklist backfill, this can't just live in memory until the task's next
       unrelated Save.** Comments write straight to Firestore on their own (`arrayUnion` on add, a
       full-array rewrite on remove via `removeCommentAt`) — never through the task-form save
       payload — so nothing else would ever persist a purely in-memory fix. `openTaskModal` runs
       the backfill and, only if it actually changed anything, writes the result back via
       `updateDoc` immediately (skips the write for tasks that need no fix, which is most of them
       once this has rolled out). This is how "apply it to existing entries" actually happens:
       progressively, the next time each task with old un-threaded replies gets opened by anyone
       on the team — not a one-time bulk migration script, since there's no service-account/admin
       Firestore access set up for this app to run one from outside the browser (see "Scheduled
       cloud routines" in the parent `Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md`) and no other durable place for a
       migration to run except through a real signed-in session.
     - The live-refresh path (the `tasks` `onSnapshot` handler re-rendering an already-open task's
       comments when someone else edits it) also runs `backfillCommentThreading` before rendering,
       not just `openTaskModal` — otherwise the moment `openTaskModal`'s own backfill write
       round-trips back through that same listener would flash the log flat/unthreaded for a beat
       before self-correcting.
     - **`sanitizeImportedComments` preserves `id`/`replyTo`** (generating a fresh id if one's
       missing or invalid, same as the backfill) instead of reconstructing every comment as bare
       `{text, date, author}` — otherwise an export/import round-trip would silently flatten every
       reply thread back into a plain list, same reasoning as why `dependsOn` survives that path.
     - **The Suggestions tab's replies are a different, already-correct shape and needed no fix**:
       one flat `replies` array *per suggestion post* (`suggestion-reply-add-btn`,
       `data-suggestion-id`), always rendered directly under that one suggestion — there's no
       "reply to a specific earlier reply" concept there at all, so nothing was ever ambiguous
       about where a reply belongs.
     - **Newest comment thread first** (asked for directly): `renderCommentsLog` sorts root threads by their LATEST activity (root or any reply, `latestActivity`) descending, so a fresh reply to an old comment brings the thread back up; replies stay oldest-first under their parent. The compose box moved ABOVE the log, and the task box's `#mention-menu` now opens below it (`top-full`) since the section label sits above. Storage order is unchanged.
     - **`#task-comments-log`'s `max-h-40` (160px) was reported as too cramped once threading
       made the log taller** — bumped to `max-h-96` (384px). Safe to grow generously: Comments is
       the last section in the task modal's own internally-scrolling form
       (`#task-form`, `overflow-y-auto`), immediately before the fixed Delete/Cancel/Save footer,
       so a taller comments pane doesn't push any other field further out of view — it only
       changes how much of the conversation shows before the log's own inner scrollbar kicks in.
     - **The task modal itself also went wider** — `max-w-2xl` (42rem) → `max-w-5xl` (64rem, ~50%
       wider), requested directly right after the taller comments log. Uses Tailwind's standard
       scale rather than an arbitrary `max-w-[...]` value; `5xl` lands within ~2% of an exact 50%
       increase, close enough that a named step reads better than a bespoke number. No other
       layout change needed — the modal's own `p-2 sm:p-4` outer padding and the form's existing
       `sm:grid-cols-2` field pairs already respond to the wider container correctly on their own.
   - **How a notification reads (desktop popup, bell, phone)**: asked "can desktop notifications be better presented?" from
     a screenshot where the reader's own "@Deane Cheng" and a two-line Frame.io address filled the popup. The popup is
     three parts: title = first name + action ("Zenon mentioned you"), first body line = the task or chat, then the
     message. `notificationSnippetText` (shared with the bell and the phone list) drops your own @mention, turns links
     into the site's name ("Frame.io link", via `linkChipLabel`), collapses spaces and cuts at a word. System alerts
     keep their headline and message unchanged. Stored snippets are untouched; this is display only.
   - **Desktop popups**: an opt-in toggle in the user menu (`btn-desktop-notif-toggle`,
     `localStorage` key `flowboard_desktop_notif`) fires a native `Notification` from the
     `notifications` `onSnapshot` listener in `startListeners` for anything added *after* the
     listener's first snapshot (`notifListenerReady` flips true once that first snapshot resolves,
     so only later `docChanges()` "added" events pop a notification — this avoids bursting the
     whole existing backlog open every page load). Deliberately not a timestamp comparison: an
     earlier version compared each notification's client-generated `at` field against this tab's
     own `Date.now()` at attach time, which silently ate popups whenever the notifying user's and
     the recipient's machine clocks disagreed (the in-app bell has no such check, so it kept
     working — only desktop popups went quiet). Tab-open-somewhere only — no service-worker push,
     no server. Requires the browser's Notification permission to be granted; a comment/mention/
     assignment never notifies its own author (see `delete recipients[myName]` in
     `notifyOnComment`, and the self-check in `notifyAssignment`), so testing needs a second
     account/tab, not a self-mention.
     - **Reported directly as "doesn't alert me immediately"** — turned out to mean the opt-in
       toggle/browser permission weren't actually active, so the in-app bell (only visible by
       opening the app) was the only signal that ever fired; not a bug in the notification
       pipeline itself, which is real-time (a live `onSnapshot`, not a poll) regardless of
       notification type.
     - **Clicking a chat-mention popup only ever opened a task, never the chat** — reported
       directly right after ("when clicking on desktop notification, it should bring me directly
       to chat"). `fireDesktopNotification`'s `n.onclick` only ever checked `notif.taskId`; a
       project chat mention carries `chatProject` instead (see `notifyOnProjectChat`), which
       this handler never looked at, so clicking one silently did nothing beyond focusing the
       window. Fixed to branch on `chatProject` the same way the notification bell's own panel
       click handler already does (`setView('chat')` + `selectChatProject(chatProject)`) — that
       existing path was never broken; this one just never reused it. The popup body also gained
       the same subject-naming `taskName` already got (`"<name>: <snippet>"`), using
       `chatProject` in place of `taskName` when present, so you can tell which chat it's about
       before clicking.
3. **Drive picker integration** — lazy-loads the Google Picker API (`ensureGapiLoaded`) so users
   can attach a Drive folder to a task/project without guessing folder names.
   - **`PICKER_API_KEY` is HTTP-referrer restricted in Google Cloud, and the site's address must
     be on its list.** After the October 2026 move to `mediashock-apac.github.io`, "Browse Drive"
     showed Google's "The API developer key is invalid" popup: the key still only allowed the old
     `deane-ms.github.io` origin (confirmed by calling the Drive API with each origin as
     `Referer` — the new one got "Requests from referer … are blocked"). Fix is in Google Cloud
     Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → that key → Website restrictions: add
     `https://mediashock-apac.github.io/*`. Sign-in itself is unaffected (it uses the Firebase key
     and Firebase's authorized domains). Any future address change needs the same step.
   - **Project and Google Drive Link are one field, not two.** They used to be separate inputs
     that a single Drive pick filled in together, and Project was `readonly` — the only way to
     set it was to browse Drive, so a project with no Drive folder couldn't be named at all.
     Now `#task-project` is free-type and doubles as the link entry point: `absorbProjectLink()`
     (on `paste` and on `change`/blur, deliberately **not** on every keystroke, or a hand-typed
     URL gets absorbed halfway through being typed) pulls any URL out of the field into a hidden
     `#task-drive` input, leaving the rest of the text as the project name. Trailing sentence
     punctuation is trimmed off the URL first, same as the sibling Content Hub's pasted-Drive-link
     handling. Still stored as two separate task fields (`project` + `driveLink`) — `project` is
     the grouping key for Projects/Gantt/People/`filters`, so it has to stay a real name and can
     never become a URL. Existing tasks need no migration.
   - **Assignee is a picker over the team roster, not a free-text field.** It used to be
     `<input list="assignee-suggestions">` — you typed a colleague's name from memory and a
     datalist merely *suggested*, so nothing stopped "Sarah" / "Sarah L" / "sarah lim" becoming
     three people in the People view, three filter options and three separate workload columns,
     only one of whom could actually be notified (see `people` in the data model below). It is now
     a real `<select>` (`renderAssigneeOptions`, run on every `openTaskModal` so someone who
     signed in thirty seconds ago is already pickable) put through the same `enhanceSelect()`
     widget as every other dropdown in this app.
     - **The currently-assigned person is always kept as an option** even if `teamRoster()`
       somehow doesn't list them. Without that, opening an old task would show a blank picker and
       saving it — for any unrelated edit — would silently reassign the task out from under them.
     - **`+ Someone else…` (`ASSIGNEE_OTHER`) is the deliberate escape hatch**, for the one case a
       roster picker can't serve: assigning work to someone before their first sign-in (a new
       starter, an intern). It reveals `#task-assignee-other`, which is otherwise hidden, so this
       is progressive disclosure rather than a second always-visible way to set the same field.
       `currentAssigneeValue()` is the single place that knows which of the two inputs is live —
       both the submit handler and `taskFormSnapshot()` call it, so the save path and the
       unsaved-changes check can't disagree about what the assignee is.
     - **No `required` attribute on the select.** `enhanceSelect()` puts the real control in
       `sr-only`, and a browser refuses to submit a form whose invalid control can't be focused —
       the form would fail silently with no message. The existing check in the submit handler
       covers it. For the same reason `setFieldError` now redirects its red outline to the
       enhanced select's *trigger button*, and `clearFieldErrors` clears it from those buttons —
       reddening an `sr-only` element shows the user nothing.
   - **Chrome's native datalist caret is hidden app-wide.** Any `<input list="...">` whose
     datalist has options gets a solid black ▼ drawn by Chrome *while the field is focused or
     hovered* — a filled UA glyph sitting right beside this app's thin stroked SVG icons, which
     reads as a foreign control. Killed with
     `input[list]::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator { display: none !important }` in the `<style>`
     block. Scoped to `input[list]` deliberately: `input[type="date"]` uses the *same*
     pseudo-element for its calendar button and must keep it. Affects Project and the Time Tracking note
     field (Assignee used to be in this list; it's a real select now, see above). Suggestions still drop down as you type; you just can't click an
     arrow to browse them cold.
     - **Testing this needs real Chrome, headed, with the field focused.** Playwright's bundled
       Chromium never draws the caret, headed or not, so a headless run "passes" whether or not
       the rule works. `getComputedStyle(el, '::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator')` is also
       useless here — it reports the UA value (`inline-block`) and ignores author overrides even
       when they're applied. The only reliable check is a pixel diff of the focused input in
       `chromium.launch({ channel: 'chrome', headless: false })`.
   - **One icon, on the right.** The field briefly had two: a brand-coloured tray glyph sitting
     decoratively on the left plus a folder glyph on the right for the Drive picker. The left one
     was purely ornamental once the field had a real affordance, so the tray glyph moved to the
     right as the Browse-Drive button and the folder was dropped. It's muted (`text-zinc-400` /
     `dark:text-zinc-500`, brand only on hover), matching every other icon button in this form —
     nothing in the Project row is brand-coloured at rest any more.
   - The attached link surfaces as a one-line link/Copy/Remove row under the field
     (`#task-project-link-row`), swapped with a `#task-project-hint` when nothing's attached —
     `syncDriveLinkButtons()` toggles both `hidden` *and* `flex` rather than relying on
     stylesheet order, matching how the task modal itself is shown/hidden.
   - The Drive picker now fills the project name **only when the field is blank**
     (`openDrivePicker`'s callback), so someone who already typed "Q3 Campaign" and then browses
     to attach the folder doesn't get their name overwritten by the folder's.
   - `#task-project` carries `maxlength="200"` so a pasted Drive URL isn't truncated before
     `absorbProjectLink()` can extract it; the 60-char limit on the *name* is enforced in the
     submit handler instead. It also has a `#project-suggestions` datalist (populated from
     `uniqueValues('project')`) — without it, free-type would quietly split "Acme Rebrand" and
     "acme rebrand" into two projects everywhere that groups by this field.
4. **Pure helpers** — date/time/formatting/sanitization utilities (no DOM or Firestore access).
5. **Modal + UI helpers** — task modal, checklist editor, time-entry editor, "enhanced select"
   dropdown widget, mention autocomplete menu.
   - **A typed-but-unsent comment used to vanish silently on Cancel *or* Save** — reported
     directly. Root cause: comments write straight to Firestore the instant Add is clicked (their
     own `arrayUnion`/full-array-rewrite calls, entirely separate from the task-form save flow),
     so a draft still sitting in `#task-comment-input` was invisible to both exit paths.
     - **Cancel/backdrop/Escape/X** already ran every close through `taskModalHasUnsavedChanges()`
       (`taskFormSnapshot()` vs. `formBaseline`, captured at `openTaskModal` time) before an
       explicit "Discard changes?" `openConfirm` — that mechanism just never looked at the comment
       box. Added `commentDraft: document.getElementById('task-comment-input').value` to the
       snapshot and the gap closes for free; `openTaskModal` already clears that field before
       capturing `formBaseline`, so a fresh open always starts at `''` there.
     - **Save had no equivalent check of any kind.** The task-form `submit` handler's body is now
       `commitTaskSave()`, a named function instead of the listener's own anonymous callback, so
       it can be invoked either immediately (no draft) or from an `openConfirm` callback ("Save
       without sending this comment?" / Save without it / Go back) when
       `#task-comment-input` has trimmed text. Deliberately a separate check from the
       Cancel-side snapshot comparison, not a reuse of it — the correct framing here isn't
       "discard everything or keep editing," it's "discard the draft specifically, or go click
       Add first," which needs its own copy naming the comment.
   - **`closeOtherHeaderPanels(exceptPanel)` enforces one floating panel/dropdown open at a
     time** — the notification bell, digest bell, user menu, and every "enhanced select"
     filter/sort menu each used to manage only their own hidden/visible state independently, so
     two could genuinely be open and stacked on top of each other at once (reported directly
     against a screenshot: "notification or drop down panels can only open one at a time"). Each
     trigger now calls it (passing itself as the exception) before toggling its own visibility,
     and `enhanceSelect`'s `openMenu()` calls it too (passing `null`, closing everything). Defined
     early, next to `closeOtherEnhancedSelectMenus`, even though `userMenuPanel`/`digestPanel`/
     `notificationPanel` aren't assigned until much further down the file — safe, since `var`
     hoists them and the function body only actually runs from a later click, well after module
     init has set all three.
   - `setFieldError(inputEl, message)` walks *up* from the input looking for the field's
     `.field-error` `<p>`, rather than only checking the input's immediate parent. Fields wrapped
     in a `.relative` div for an overlaid icon (Project) keep their `.field-error` outside that
     wrapper, so the original one-level lookup silently found nothing and those fields' validation
     messages never appeared at all — the input just turned red with no explanation.
6. **Task mutations** — `deleteTask`, `updateTaskStatus`, `replaceAllTasks` (import), archive/
   unarchive — all writing directly to Firestore; there is no local-first optimistic queue beyond
   what `onSnapshot` naturally re-renders.
7. **View renderers** — one function per view: `renderBoard` (kanban + drag-and-drop), `renderGantt`,
   `renderCalendar`, `renderPeople`, `renderProjects`, `renderActivityFeed`, `renderArchived`,
   `renderFocus` ("Focus of the Day"), `renderSuggestions`. `setView`/`renderCurrentSecondaryView`
   switch between them; `renderAll` re-runs the relevant renderer(s) after any data change.
   - **Standing rule: a change to the Timeline is also made to the WIP Meeting timeline**
     (`wipTimelineHtml`), unless it would add confusion or isn't needed there — stated directly
     after the two drifted apart several times. If WIP is deliberately skipped, say why.
   - **Bars are `GANTT_BAR_HEIGHT` (20px), centred in the row, on both timelines.** They were
     `rowHeight - 12` (40px) on the Timeline and ~30px on WIP; once bars went solid, a near
     row-height block per task drowned the weekend/today shading, leave stripes and diamonds and
     left no gap between rows. The Timeline row stays 52px for the two-line label.
   - **The Progress column and its toggle are GONE (2026-10-06)**, on request: "is the progress column
     and button necessary anymore? i want to keep things simple and intuitive", then "do it". The
     toggle made one number mean two things (checklist share vs status stage), and what the column
     said was already on screen: diamonds show checklist steps done/open/late, and bar colour shows
     Ready for review and Done. Day columns now start at grid track **2** (`colCursor = 2`, day header
     `i + 2`, rows `2 / -1`), and the today line is `GANTT_LABEL_WIDTH + todayIndex * dayWidth`. The
     bar's hover title carries "N/M checklist steps done". **Don't add a percentage or a bar fill
     back.** Verified by rendering the real app in Chromium with Firebase stubbed (diamonds and bars on
     the right days, no page errors). The three bullets below are the history of the column.
   - **The Timeline has two frozen columns, not one: `Task` (track 1) and `Progress`
     (track 2, `GANTT_PCT_WIDTH`).** Day columns therefore start at grid track **3**, and the
     bar rows span `3 / -1` — the single easiest thing to break when touching this grid, since
     the month header (`colCursor`), the day header (`i + 3`), the bar rows and the today line
     (`GANTT_LABEL_WIDTH + GANTT_PCT_WIDTH + ...`) all have to agree. The Progress column is a
     fixed width and not resizable: it holds one short number, so a drag has nothing to reveal.
     Both its cells carry `.gantt-pct`, because a sticky `left` offset does NOT move when the
     grid track does — the Task-column resize drag has to rewrite it explicitly, the same way
     it already rewrites the today line.
   - **The percentage is derived, never stored**, and follows the Progress toggle between
     checklist completion and status stage. Pipeline shows 0%.
   - **The Progress column is the ONLY progress signal; bars are solid, with no fill and no
     "3/5" count** (Timeline and the WIP Meeting timeline both). The bars used to fill
     left-to-right by percent, and a fill edge on a date axis reads as a date ("done up to
     here"). Once checklist items got real dates (the diamonds) the two contradicted each other:
     on a 28 Sep–16 Oct bar at 60%, the fill reached ~8 Oct and covered an *open* item due 6 Oct,
     so it looked finished. Asked directly ("is it conflicting and confusing?"); TeamGantt
     avoids the clash by not dating checklist items at all. Now: column = how much is done,
     diamonds = what's due when. **Don't re-add a bar fill while the diamonds exist.** The WIP
     timeline has no Progress column, so it shows no percentage at all.
   - **`renderGantt` stacking tiers** (all below 30, so a sticky Gantt cell can never cover the
     app header at `z-40` or its notification/user-menu panels at `z-30` — `z-40` vs `z-40` did
     exactly that once, with the corner cell covering the mobile nav menu):
     `28` the toolbar's own dropdown menus · `26` corner · `25` month + day header (the frozen
     top row) · `20` task label + Progress cells (the two frozen columns) · `15` today line
     · `0` leave bands then bars.
     - **The toolbar dropdowns are in this list because they collide with the chart, even though
       they are not part of it.** `#filter-people-menu` and every `enhanceSelect()` menu
       (Priority, Project, Sort) were `z-20`, and the toolbar sits *above* the Gantt in the DOM —
       so on the Timeline tab the frozen header painted straight through an open dropdown,
       reported from a screenshot of the People list with day columns running across it. They are
       `z-[28]` now: clear of the chart's 26, still under the app header's panels at 30. Anything
       new that floats over `<main>` needs a z-index above 26 for the same reason.
     - **The header used to be `z-10`, *below* the label column's `z-20`**, on the reasoning that
       the two can never overlap because "one owns the header rows, the other owns a task row."
       That holds only while nothing scrolls. A sticky header travels down over the rows beneath
       it, and at that moment the task names painted straight over the month and day numbers —
       reported from a screenshot. A frozen top row has to out-rank the other frozen edge.
     - **Raising the z-index alone was not enough.** The header cells were semi-transparent
       (`dark:bg-zinc-700/80`, and the weekend/today tints at `/70`, `/40`, `/10`), so bars
       scrolling underneath still showed through as ghost blocks. Every cell in both header rows
       is a solid colour now.
     - **There is exactly ONE scroll pane: the `overflow-auto` box `renderGantt` emits**, and it
       **must carry no height cap**. `#gantt-wrap` has no `overflow` of its own and must keep it
       that way. Two separate passes each added a second vertical scroller here and both were
       reported the same day:
       - adding `overflow: auto` to `#gantt-wrap` as well (nesting a second scroller around the
         existing one) — "do not have two separate scroll bars... make it all into one";
       - the pane's own `max-height: 600px`, which made it overflow vertically and draw its own
         scrollbar a few pixels from the page's — "it is still showing two vertical scrollbars?"
       With the height unconstrained the box grows to fit every row, so nothing overflows
       vertically and only the page's scrollbar is drawn. It still scrolls **horizontally**
       (the grid inside is `width: max-content`), which is what the frozen column sticks against
       — so `overflow-auto` itself has to stay.
       **Before changing anything here, check which element actually scrolls** —
       `wrap.firstElementChild` was the grid before that box existed and is the pane now, so
       stale assumptions about it are easy to carry in.
     - **The month/day header no longer freezes while you scroll the page, and that is the
       accepted cost of one scrollbar.** A sticky element resolves against its nearest
       scroll-container ancestor, and the pane is still one even when only its horizontal axis
       overflows — so `sticky top-0` is pinned to a box that never scrolls vertically. The frozen
       *column* is unaffected (it sticks against the axis that does scroll). Getting the header
       frozen back while still showing one scrollbar means sizing the whole Timeline view to the
       viewport so the pane becomes the page's only vertical scroller — a layout change, not a
       height tweak. **Do not just put `max-height` back; that is exactly where the second
       scrollbar came from.**
     - **`width: max-content` on `#gantt-grid` is what actually freezes the Task column** —
       reported directly ("freeze the task column so it always stays in view"). Nothing to do with
       `overflow`, which is why the first attempt (adding a scroll pane) changed nothing visible
       except adding a second scrollbar.
       With `min-width: 100%` alone the grid *box* is only as wide as the pane while its columns
       overflow it, and **a sticky element is constrained to its containing block** — so the label
       cells could travel roughly one paneful and then slid off to the left. Verified in an
       isolated fixture rather than guessed: scrolled 1400px right, the label's
       `getBoundingClientRect().left` sat **869px to the left of** the pane; with `max-content` it
       lands exactly *on* the pane's left edge. `min-width: 100%` stays for the opposite case (a
       short date range whose columns don't fill the pane). The vertical header was never
       affected, which is why the top row looked correct throughout and made this read as a
       column-only problem.
     - **The chart centres on today when the Timeline tab is opened, and never moves on its own
       after that** — asked for in exactly those terms ("it should be free scrolling but coming
       back to Timeline tab should default to showing today").
       - **`ganttCenterOnToday` means "nobody has scrolled this chart yet", NOT "centre once".**
         It shipped as the latter — set on tab open, cleared by the first render that honoured
         it — and the Timeline still opened at the range start, reported back directly. The
         mechanism was never the problem: setting `scrollLeft` straight after an `innerHTML` swap
         was verified to stick, and the 30%-into-the-day-area maths is correct. The one-shot was
         simply being consumed by a render *other than* the one left on screen. `renderGantt`
         runs from `setView`, from `renderAll` on every tasks/people/projects snapshot, from the
         Progress toggle and from the label-resize mouseup — the 60-second presence heartbeat
         alone is enough to fire one. Whichever consumed it, the next render took the `else`
         branch and restored a scroll position of 0.
       - **So it now re-centres on every render until the person actually touches the chart**,
         which removes the ordering question rather than trying to win it. Cleared by real input
         on the pane — `wheel`/`pointerdown`/`touchstart`/`keydown`, attached fresh each render
         and dying with the pane. **Deliberately not a `scroll` listener**: the centring itself
         fires one, so the flag would cancel itself the instant it was honoured.
       - Verified by driving the exact sequence that broke the one-shot: open (1543 = today),
         three unrelated re-renders (1543 each), user scrolls to 900, re-render (900 preserved),
         reopen the tab (1543 again).
       - The older half, still true: `ganttCenterOnToday` is set in `setView('gantt')`; every other render
       captures the outgoing pane's `scrollLeft`/`scrollTop` before the `innerHTML` swap and
       restores them afterward. The old code re-centred on *every* render and justified it as
       "instead of leaving that to chance" — which was harmless only because it was simultaneously
       setting `scrollLeft` on an element that does not scroll, so it never ran at all. Fixing
       that without this would have meant any unrelated snapshot (a teammate's edit, a roster
       heartbeat, a project-deadline change) yanking the chart back to today mid-read. The Content
       Hub's chat log had the identical bug and is fixed the same way.
     - **Two long-broken things fixed as a consequence**: "keep today in view" was setting
       `scrollLeft` on the grid rather than the pane, so it had silently done nothing for as long
       as it existed. And the label-resize drag measured `containerLeft` from the grid's rect,
       which moves negative as the chart scrolls — both now read the pane
       (`wrap.firstElementChild`), so resizing while scrolled away from the start no longer jumps.
     - **Do not give these cells a `top` offset to clear the app's own sticky header.** Tried
       and reverted the same day. `position: sticky` with `top: 200px` does not mean "stop 200px
       down once you scroll there" — it means "never come closer than 200px to the scroll
       container's top edge", which the header satisfies **immediately, before any scrolling**,
       by dropping 200px down into the middle of the chart and floating over rows 3–4, leaving a
       blank band where it belonged. Reported from a screenshot within minutes of shipping.
       `top-0` / `top-8` are correct. The app header (`sticky top-0 z-40`) does still sit above
       the frozen row when the page scrolls; if that ever needs solving, the fix is to make the
       chart its own scroll container — `#gantt-wrap` currently sets **no `overflow` at all**, so
       the page is the scroll container and `scrollWrap.scrollLeft` in the "keep today in view"
       block is a no-op — not to offset the sticky cells.
   - **Checklist items can carry an optional `due` date, drawn as diamonds on the task's Timeline
     bar.** Set from the row's single pencil, which opens one inline editor (text, link, date / TBD, Done) -- it replaced
     separate link and calendar icon buttons per row, which were clutter once the add-item row carried those fields. Green = done, rose = overdue and open, grey = upcoming; hover names the item, click
     opens the task. No extra rows (so the single scroll pane is untouched), skipped if outside
     the visible range, and a Done task never shows overdue items. A date after the task's own
     deadline is flagged amber in the editor and tooltip rather than blocked. Deliberately NOT fed
     into `dueUrgency`, Focus, the digest or notifications (more overdue signals, more noise).
     - **Expandable checklist rows** (built later, asked for from a TeamGantt screenshot). A task
       with a checklist gets an arrow in its label (`ganttExpandToggleHtml`, `data-gantt-expand`);
       opening it adds one indented row per item (`GANTT_ITEM_ROW_HEIGHT` 34px) on both the
       Timeline and the WIP timeline. Each row: tick when done, name, assignee's avatar, date (or
       TBD / No date) in the label, and a slightly larger diamond on its due date. Items are
       sorted by due date, undated last (`ganttChecklistItems`), so diamonds step down left to
       right. While open, the task's own bar drops its small diamonds — the rows carry them.
       State is `ganttExpanded`, session-only, shared by both views, collapsed by default.
       **The label text toggles too, not just the arrow** (asked for directly): the project/task
       block beside the arrow carries the same `data-gantt-expand` (`ganttExpandLabelAttrs`), so
       one click handler serves both, on both timelines. Tasks with no checklist get no attribute
       and the label stays inert.
       - **Diamonds, not bars**: items have only a due date. Bars would need a start date on every
         item; offered and declined. **No dependency arrows** (task dependencies were removed —
         see below), and **no project grouping** (reverted before — see `projects`). This expands
         a *task*, not a project.
       - On the Timeline every item row is three grid cells sharing one `data-gantt-row` key
         (`"<r>-<k>"`), so the existing row-hover delegation lights up the whole row and links the
         name to its diamond. The grid's row tracks are built per row (`rowTracks`) since item rows
         are shorter; the resize handle and today line span `rowTracks.length`, not `list.length`.
       - The WIP version is a plain flex row (label and chart in one element). Its task rows and
         item rows carry `data-gantt-row="w<r>"` / `"w<r>-<k>"` (the `w` prefix keeps keys from
         colliding with the Timeline's) and get the same `.gantt-row-hover` highlight. A Tailwind
         `hover:bg-*` class was tried first and showed nothing on WIP; the shared highlight class
         is `!important` precisely because of the CDN cascade-order problem documented on it.
     - **"Add to Google Calendar"** (`openChecklistInGoogleCalendar`, ): only offered on the add-item row, as a "Calendar" checkbox next to the date (a per-item link on the
       `Due …` line and a per-row icon both shipped and were removed as clutter -- an existing item is not
       re-exportable). The add-item row carries link, date, TBD and Calendar fields on the
       same line (wrapping when narrow -- no disclosure; asked for directly), so all of it can be set before
       adding; a **TBD** option (item field `dueTbd`, a separate boolean -- never a non-date string in `due`, which every Timeline/WIP/import reader parses as a date) shows "Due TBD" and draws no marker; picking a date clears it; its calendar checkbox stays disabled until a date is chosen and opens the event on Add. It opens Google Calendar's
       pre-filled event-template URL (all-day event, task deep link in the description; guests are
       the step's own people when it has any, else the task owner and "involved" emails). **Google
       Meet is added in Google's own form** ("Add Google Meet video conferencing", plus a time):
       asked "can creating a date ... have the option of creating a Google Meet?", and the template
       URL has no Meet parameter. A Project Manager button that creates the Meet and stores its link
       needs the Calendar API with OAuth, so it was deferred; inviting the step's people was the part
       worth building. **One-way and one-time by design** -- no API, no OAuth; changing
       the date here later does not update the event. A real two-way sync (Meet links, free/busy)
       was weighed and deferred; it would need a Google Cloud OAuth client and an optional time field.
     `due` is only set when valid because Firestore rejects `undefined` field values.
   - `renderGantt`: day-column width is capped (`GANTT_MAX_DAY_WIDTH`) so a short date range doesn't
     stretch into oversized solid-color bars; the sticky Task label column needs a higher `z-index`
     than the today-line and day-grid content or bars paint over it (they're normal-flow siblings
     with no explicit z-index, so DOM order wins by default); the "scroll to keep today in view"
     math has to subtract the label column's width from the viewport before positioning, or it
     lands the target under the sticky column on narrow cards. Only tasks with *both* a
     `startDate` and a `deadline` can plot a bar; both are individually optional elsewhere (the
     "TBD" deadline checkbox in the task modal), so a task can be otherwise fully filled-in and
     still have nothing to draw. `#gantt-hidden-note` (updated at the top of `renderGantt`) says
     how many filtered-in tasks are missing one or both dates, so they don't just silently vanish
     from this view with no indication anything's hidden — same reasoning for the empty-state
     message when *every* filtered task is missing a date. Bar/dot color comes from `pm`,
     chosen as `Done` → `DONE_META` (green) → else `isReadyForReview(t)` → `READY_FOR_REVIEW_META`
     (purple) → else `PRIORITY_META[t.priority]`. **Ready for review** means `status === 'Review'`
     *and* every checklist item is checked off (an empty checklist doesn't count — nothing to
     have finished) — fully done from the assignee's side, just waiting on someone else's
     sign-off, so priority no longer says much about what to look at. Same `pm`-shape object as
     `PRIORITY_META`/`DONE_META` (`badge`/`dot`/`bar`/`barLight`/`border`), Gantt-only for now —
     Board cards, Focus of the Day, and People/Projects still color purely by priority/Done.
     - **The sticky Task label column leads with the project, not the task** — same field-priority
       swap as the Board cards (`t.project` bold, `t.assignee + ' · ' + t.name` muted underneath;
       used to be `t.name` bold / `assignee · project` underneath). Asked for directly after
       seeing the Board's version. Deliberately **not** a rerun of the Gantt's project-*grouping*
       revert (`db57071` — row-per-project header/summary-bar, reverted for not working on the
       real board): this is a label-text swap on the same flat, date-sorted row list that already
       exists, nothing about row order, count, or the chronological alignment a Gantt exists for
       changes. That's the actual reason grouping failed there and a plain swap doesn't share it.
   - **`dueUrgency(t)`** is the single source of truth for "overdue"/"due soon", shared by the
     Board badges, stats bar, Projects tab's per-project overdue chip, People view, and the This
     Week digest. It exempts `status === 'Review'` the same way it already exempted `'Done'` —
     once a task is sent off for review (client or internal sign-off), the clock isn't really the
     assignee's anymore, so flagging it OVERDUE the day after its original deadline is a false
     alarm about someone else's response time, not the assignee falling behind. `renderFocus`
     shows a dedicated blue "Under review" label for the same status instead of a days-based one
     (`Xd overdue`/`Due today`/etc.), and `focusScore` skips its urgency boost for Review tasks
     too — otherwise a heavily-overdue-but-in-review task would still dominate the top of Focus
     of the Day by sort score even with a calm badge. That in turn meant Review tasks could get
     crowded out of the strip's 6-slot cap entirely by unrelated overdue work elsewhere, so
     `renderFocus` reserves up to `FOCUS_REVIEW_RESERVED` (2) slots for the highest-priority
     Review tasks before filling the rest of the 6 normally — guaranteed a little visibility
     without letting Review tasks dominate the strip the way the old urgency boost did.
   - **The Sort dropdown drives the Focus of the Day strip too** — asked for directly ("Focus of
     the day should also apply to sorting"). It decides **both which six and their order**, via
     the same `sortTasksForDisplay()` the Board columns use, so "Sort: Deadline" really means the
     six soonest rather than the six highest-scoring shown in date order.
     - **`sortBy === 'focus'` keeps the old path exactly, reserved Review slots and all.** Those
       two slots exist to stop Review tasks being crowded out of a focus-*scored* strip (see
       `dueUrgency`'s Review exemption); under an explicit Deadline/Priority/Project sort there is
       no score to be crowded out of, and holding two slots back would contradict the sort the
       person just picked.
     - **`FOCUS_CAPTIONS` re-labels the strip per mode** ("— next 6 by deadline", etc.), set from
       inside `renderFocus` rather than the sort handler so the caption can never describe an
       order the list isn't in. The default text stays "highest priority & most urgent,
       auto-sorted", which stops being true the moment another sort is chosen.
     - **The `sort-by` change handler had to gain a `renderFocus()` call** — it drove the Board
       and the secondary views but never the strip, which didn't matter while the strip ignored
       `filters.sortBy` entirely. Without it the sort appears to do nothing up there until some
       unrelated change triggers a full `renderAll()`.
     - **The strip still ignores the Priority/Project/People filters and the search box** — only
       *sorting* was asked for, and it remains `activeTasks()`-wide rather than filtered. Worth
       revisiting as its own decision if the split ever reads as inconsistent.
     - Verified with an isolated Node port of the selection logic against synthetic tasks (same
       two-track approach as the Calendar span logic): focus mode still returns 6 and still keeps
       both Review tasks; deadline returns the six soonest in date order; priority leads with
       every High; project groups alphabetically and sorts the unprojected task last overall.
   - **`focusScore(t)`** (shared by `renderFocus` and the Board's "Sort: Focus" option) weighs
     deadline proximity above priority tier, not just alongside it: a Low-priority task due
     today outscores a High-priority task due in three weeks. Priority (`PRIORITY_WEIGHT × 1000`)
     is the tiebreaker among similarly-urgent tasks, or the only signal once nothing has a
     near-term deadline — it was previously the dominant term for anything not yet overdue (the
     old near-term boost topped out at +450, dwarfed by the 1000-point gap between priority
     tiers), which let a High-priority task with weeks of runway rank above something actually
     due soon.
   - **Board columns render one card per project, not one card per task** (`groupTasksByProject`
     + `projectGroupCardHtml` + `boardTaskRowHtml`, all called from `renderBoard`). This *is*
     project-row-grouping, on the one view where the earlier Gantt attempt at the same idea
     (`db57071` — "didn't work in practice on the real board") doesn't apply: a Gantt row's whole
     point is chronological alignment (who's doing what at the same time), and clustering by
     project breaks that. A Kanban column has no such axis — it's already siloed by status — so
     this is closer to a plain Jira/Trello swimlane than to what was reverted there.
     - `groupTasksByProject(list)` clusters an *already-sorted* column's tasks by project without
       reordering them — a project's group appears wherever its first (best-sorted) task would
       have anyway, and tasks keep their relative order within the group. So the "Sort: Focus /
       Priority / Deadline / Project" dropdown still controls order (which project card comes
       first, and row order within it) — it just no longer controls *whether* tasks cluster,
       which happens unconditionally regardless of sort mode.
     - **`projectGroupCardHtml(g)`** is the one wrapper every project gets — project name as the
       card header (on its own tinted band, `bg-zinc-100` / `dark:bg-zinc-700/60`, in
       `zinc-900`/white, while task names step down to `zinc-700`/`zinc-200` — asked for as "better
       contrast between project name and tasks"; title and rows used to share one background), tasks underneath as `divide-y`-separated rows — whether the project has one
       task or five. That "always the same treatment" is what actually resolved the repeated
       feedback about grouped and ungrouped cards looking inconsistent: there's no longer a
       second look to be inconsistent with.
     - **`boardTaskRowHtml(t)`** is a compact three-line row (task name; then assignee; then a
       priority/status badge, deadline with a calendar icon, logged time, and an OVERDUE/DUE
       TODAY/DUE TOMORROW badge when relevant). **The priority dot is gone from Board rows** (asked
       directly): the coloured MEDIUM/HIGH/Completed badge says the same thing at a fixed left
       position, so the meta lines lost their `pl-[18px]` indent too and everything aligns left.
       Older notes below about the dot describe the earlier design.
       **Row actions now show on hover, and the pencil is gone** (asked: "simplify visually or
       increase ease of use"). Clicking the row already opens the task window, so the pencil was a
       second control for one action. Drag/Archive/Delete sit in `.board-row-actions`, hidden at rest
       on hover-capable devices (`@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`) and shown on row hover
       or focus-within; always visible on touch. `display`, not opacity, so long names get the full
       width at rest. This is deliberately hover-REVEAL, not removal: an earlier removal of these
       icons was reported as "compromising on usability". **MEDIUM stays yellow (`PRIORITY_META.Medium`)
       everywhere.** A quiet grey MEDIUM badge (so the few HIGHs stand out from a column of
       yellow) shipped on the Board, spread to Focus of the Day, and was then reverted on request:
       the Medium dots, the Focus card's left edge and the Timeline/WIP/Calendar bars all stayed
       yellow, so one priority had two colours. **Don't give one view its own Medium colour**;
       if Medium ever changes, change `PRIORITY_META` so every mark moves together.
       not a shrunken version of the old full task-card. Checklist/comment
       counts and the Drive-link shortcut stay dropped — reachable by opening the task
       (`data-open-task`, unchanged). Time logged (`taskTimeMinutes(t)`, clock icon +
       `formatDuration`) came back after its removal was reported directly ("the time or hrs are
       missing where it was there originally") — only shown when non-zero, same as the old card's
       conditional. **Edit/Archive/Delete icon buttons shipped removed, then came back too** —
       their first removal was reported as a real usability loss ("icons and buttons are missing
       now, compromising on usability"), not just fewer badges: those are core actions people
       expect to reach without opening the full modal first, unlike the purely-informational
       counts/link that stayed cut. Row padding also went `py-2.5` → `py-3` and the metadata
       line's top margin `mt-0.5` → `mt-1` after the same feedback called the rows "too cramp." The gap *between* project
       cards in a column (`data-column-body`'s own `gap-*`) went `gap-2.5` → `gap-4` on a
       follow-up "space out the cards more" — a separate axis from the in-row padding above; both
       needed their own pass. The project title itself went `text-sm` → `text-base` (matching the
       column header `<h3>`'s size) for clearer hierarchy over the `text-sm` task names below it.
       **A visible priority/status badge (`pm.badge`, "MEDIUM"/"HIGH"/"Completed") came back into
       the metadata line too** — the priority dot next to the task name (still there) was reported
       as insufficient on its own ("priority labels are missing"): a colored dot backed only by a
       hover `title` isn't actually readable at a glance, which the badge fixes without removing
       the dot's quick left-edge color scan down a column of rows. That badge landing right next
       to the avatar/assignee/date with only `gap-1.5` between everything then got its own "too
       cluttered" report — the metadata line's gap went `gap-1.5` → `gap-2`, badge/overdue/
       due-soon pills' padding `px-1` → `px-1.5`, and the gap under the task name `mt-1` → `mt-1.5`;
       the avatar+assignee pair is now wrapped in its own flex span so they stay visually paired
       as one unit as the surrounding gap grows, and the `·` separator between assignee and date
       was dropped — redundant once real spacing does that job instead.
       **The metadata is now two stacked rows, not one wrapping strip** — avatar+assignee on its
       own line, then priority badge / deadline / logged time / urgency badges together on the
       next. Before that it led with the priority badge sitting directly next to the avatar with
       only the row's normal `gap-2` between them — two similarly compact, colorful elements with
       nothing to tell them apart, which read as one cluttered blob rather than two distinct facts
       (reported against a screenshot: "separate the name and the priority badge"). The first fix
       kept them on one `flex-wrap` line split by a 1px vertical divider, but at real board-column
       widths that line wrapped *mid-cluster* — the badge landing beside the name and the date/time
       orphaned below — so the same screenshot came back with "put the priority badge, date and
       time in one row, the name on a row on its own." Two explicit rows make the break point
       structural instead of width-dependent, which is the thing a divider on a wrapping line
       can't do; the divider is gone with it, since separate rows already say "different kinds of
       information." The second row keeps `flex-wrap` purely as a narrow-column fallback.
       **The two meta lines span the full card width; only the task name shares a line with the
       Edit/Archive/Delete buttons.** The row was originally one horizontal flex — dot, a
       `min-w-0 flex-1` text column, then the button cluster — so every line inside that text
       column, meta lines included, was ~100px narrower than the card, even though the buttons are
       24px tall and the space beside the meta lines was empty. At a 4-column (`xl:grid-cols-4`)
       board that shortfall was enough to push logged time onto its own line anyway, defeating the
       stacking above — reported as "why are the times here in a separate line?" So the row is now
       `flex flex-col`: a top line (dot + name + buttons) and the meta block below it, indented
       `pl-[18px]` (the dot's `w-2` + the top line's `gap-2.5`) so it aligns under the name with
       the dot still alone on the left edge for a column-wide priority scan. Reclaiming that width
       was preferred over shrinking the badge/date/time type, which would have bought less room
       and cost legibility.
       Still carries `class="task-card"` and `data-task-id` despite being visually a row now, so
       `attachBoardDnD`'s existing `.task-card` drag wiring and CSS (`.dragging`,
       `.task-just-completed`) keep working unchanged — only the inner grip span
       (`data-drag-handle`) is actually `draggable="true"`; the dragstart it fires bubbles up to
       whatever ancestor has the listener, so a row works exactly like the old card did there.
     - **Three iterations landed here, not one.** A dot/uppercase-label/left-border header on
       cards that stayed full-size was reported as clutter — a visual motif existing nowhere else
       on a card. Removing the header but keeping full-size cards (just tighter-spaced, first
       card naming the project) was reported as still not what was meant. What was actually
       wanted — confirmed against a text mockup before building it a third time, after two misses
       — was a real project-card container with a task list inside it, each row still showing
       assignee/deadline. `renderFocus`'s Focus-of-the-Day cards are unaffected by any of this —
       a narrower, always-just-this-person's-work strip that was never part of this request.
   - **Project cards collapse to their header by default, and Ongoing sits above Completed**
     (asked for directly from a screenshot of one project's task list running down the page).
     The toggle is a labelled bordered pill under the hours ("Show N tasks ⌄" / "Hide tasks ⌃",
     brand-tinted while open) — it started as a bare chevron beside the name and was reported as
     not obvious enough. The name is also a `.project-expand-toggle`, as a shortcut. Open state is `projectExpanded[name]`,
     session-local, so live snapshots don't snap a card shut. A search hit on a project's tasks
     opens that card (`p.searchHit`) and opens Completed. Completed's own open state is
     `projectsCompletedOpen`, recorded from the summary *click*, not the `toggle` event, which a
     render forcing it open also fires. Each section lays cards out `lg:grid-cols-2`.
     - **The Ongoing/Completed headings are full-size titles** (`text-lg font-bold`, normal case)
       with the count in a neutral pill (`projectSectionCount`) — they were tiny grey uppercase
       captions ("ONGOING (12)") and reported as not prominent enough. Completed's summary keeps
       its disclosure chevron and gains a brand hover, since it's the clickable one.
     - **A Completed project card (`activeCount === 0`) gets the Board's Done green** — the exact
       `bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-500/10` wash `boardTaskRowHtml`'s `rowBg` uses, on the card
       header, plus an emerald border. One colour for "finished" across views. Header only: the
       expanded task rows stay neutral so an open card doesn't turn into a block of green.
   - `renderProjects`: splits into **Ongoing** (sorted by `nextDeadline` ascending) and **Completed**
     (sorted by `lastArchivedAt` descending, collapsible) stacked sections (formerly side by side), not one flat list —
     each task/project row also has a separate amber "OT" badge (`taskOvertimeMinutes`) next to its
     billable time. A project is "Completed" purely by every one of its tasks having `archivedAt`
     set (`activeCount === 0`), not by task `status` — a project can be all-`Done` and still show
     as Ongoing until someone (or `checkProjectDeadlinePopups`, below) actually archives them.
     - **`openCount` (active *and* not `Done`) is tracked separately from `activeCount` (active,
       regardless of status) specifically so the card header doesn't lie by omission.** It used to
       show an unqualified "N active tasks" even when every one of those tasks was already
       `Done` — reading as a contradiction next to task rows that literally said "Completed"
       right below it (reported as "why is this project still in Ongoing?" against a project
       whose only task showed Completed). `projectCardHtml` now picks the label based on
       `openCount` vs `activeCount`: genuinely open work still reads "N active tasks"; a project
       where `openCount === 0 && activeCount > 0` reads "All N tasks done" instead, in emerald,
       plus a **`.project-archive-btn`** ("Ready to archive") that calls the existing
       `archiveProjectTasks` directly via `confirmArchiveProject` — same confirm copy and same
       archive call as `promptProjectReadyToComplete`, just reachable any time every task is
       Done rather than gated on the project's deadline having passed, and not part of the
       once-per-session popup queue. Delegated on `#projects-grid` alongside the two existing
       deadline handlers, same reasoning (innerHTML gets replaced on every snapshot).
   - Checklist items support drag-to-reorder (native HTML5 DnD) in `renderChecklistEditor`.
   - **Task modal simplification pass** (asked "how can this be visually simpler without
     compromising usability", then 1-3 of the shortlist built):
     - **Completed checklist items fold under "N done"** (`checklistDoneOpen`, `.checklist-done-toggle`),
       because open items were scrolled out of sight below finished ones. An item ticked during
       the current open of the modal stays in place, struck through (`checklistShownDone`), so a
       row never vanishes under the cursor and can be unticked; it folds away next time. Both
       reset in `openTaskModal`. Rows keep their real array index, so drag-reorder is unchanged.
     - **The checklist has no inner scroll box any more** (it was `max-h-40` inside a modal that
       already scrolls: two scrollbars, rows cut off mid-item).
     - **Checklist links are a chip naming the site** (`linkChipLabel`/`linkChipHtml`: Google
       Slides/Docs/Sheets/Drive, Frame.io, Figma, Canva, YouTube…, else the bare host), full URL in
       the tooltip. The raw URL was longer than the item name and brighter than it. **The chip is brand-tinted
       (`text-brand-800` on `bg-brand-50`; `brand-300` in dark)**, asked "should the links be more prominent?":
       grey read as a label, not a link, and brand is what every other clickable link here uses.
       `brand-700` measured ~4.2:1 at 11px, under 4.5:1, so it's 800.
     - **Time entries are one line each** (avatar, fixed-width duration, item/note, date, actions).
       The per-row Billable pill only shows when entries are mixed; when all are billable the
       total reads "6h 30m logged · all billable" once. Overtime always shows on its row.
     - **"Also involved" adds people from a small dashed "+ Add" pill** at the end of the chips (a
       native `<select>` styled as a pill, `showPicker()` on open) instead of a full-width field.
     - **@mentions are coloured bold text, no filled pill** — in `enrichCommentText`, so chat
       messages changed too.
   - `checkProjectDeadlinePopups()` (called after every `tasks` `onSnapshot`, guarded by
     `projectPopupShown` so each qualifying project only prompts once per session) nudges a
     project's own assignee(s) — anyone with at least one active task in it — around its
     deadline, defined as the *latest* deadline among its active tasks (when the whole project
     is meant to be done, not just its next task): if that date has arrived or passed and every
     active task is `status === 'Done'`, `promptProjectReadyToComplete` offers to bulk-archive
     them via `archiveProjectTasks` (same batched-write shape as the existing "Archive completed"
     board action, scoped to one project); if it's due today and something isn't done yet,
     `promptProjectDueToday` is a plain reminder, no action taken. Both reuse `openConfirm`
     (tone `'question'`) and are serialized through a small queue (`enqueueProjectPopup`/
     `advanceProjectPopupQueue`) so two qualifying projects in the same snapshot don't stomp each
     other's modal state — and both defer entirely while the task modal or another confirm is
     already open, rather than interrupting an edit in progress.
   - **Workload spike warnings** (`checkWorkloadSpikes`, alongside `checkProjectDeadlinePopups`
     in the same `tasks` `onSnapshot` handler) — asked for directly, chosen from a shortlist of
     "reactive, while someone has the app open" automations (the broader ask was "build agents
     for PM tool to enable some sort of automation," narrowed down first to *reactive* rather
     than a scheduled background service — see "Cloud Storage"-adjacent infra note below on why a
     true background agent touching live Firestore data isn't just a code change — and then to
     this one specific rule from a menu of candidates).
     - **Reuses the Gantt's own `computeGanttDeadlineStacks` trigger exactly** — one assignee, 2+
       non-Done tasks sharing the exact same deadline — rather than a fuzzier "within N days of
       each other" window, deliberately. That fuzzier shape was already tried once, as the
       Gantt's *original* conflict warning (date-RANGE overlap across a person's tasks), and
       reported back as not actually useful: one person working across several projects'
       overlapping ranges is normal, just a sequencing question. Same-deadline stacking is the
       one signal this codebase has already confirmed is worth a warning; this only adds a
       `priority === 'High'` filter (the Gantt's own version isn't priority-scoped) and turns it
       from a passive visual into an actual notification.
     - **Notifies the affected assignee directly, via the existing `notifications` collection**
       (`notifyOnWorkloadSpike`, `type: 'workload_spike'`) rather than a local toast — the person
       who triggers this check (by having Flowboard open when a `tasks` snapshot fires) is very
       often *not* the affected assignee, so there's no "current viewer" to show a toast to that
       would actually reach the right person. Reuses the bell badge and (if opted in) the desktop
       popup for free; no new UI surface. It doesn't fit the existing "author verb subject"
       template built for a *person* doing something to a *thing* (this is a system observation,
       not an action by anyone) — see `systemAlertHeadline`, below, for the shared plain-language
       headline this and the other three system alerts use instead.
     - **Deliberately does NOT exclude the affected assignee from their own notification** —
       unlike a chat mention (excluding the person who typed it, since a self-mention is a no-op:
       you obviously know you mentioned yourself). Someone whose own tasks just piled up is
       exactly who needs telling, even if they're the one who happened to trigger the check by
       having the board open.
     - **Scans the whole board's active tasks unconditionally** (`activeTasks()`), not whatever's
       currently filtered — unlike the Gantt's passive version, which only ever sees `rows`
       already narrowed by that view's own filters. A proactive notification has no "current
       view" to scope itself to.
     - **`workloadSpikeWarned` dedupes per exact cluster, not per assignee+deadline** — keyed by
       `assignee|deadline|sorted task ids`, so a cluster gaining or losing a task (a materially
       different pile-up) gets a fresh notification, while the same unchanged cluster only ever
       notifies once per session. Session-local like `projectPopupShown` above, for the same
       reason: reloading the page could in theory re-notify about an already-flagged,
       still-unresolved spike once more, an accepted minor inaccuracy rather than something worth
       persisting to Firestore or `localStorage` to fully close.
     - **A true scheduled/background version of this (or any other automation) was considered and
       set aside, not built** — this app has no service-account/admin Firestore access set up for
       anything outside a real signed-in browser session (see the checklist-threading backfill's
       own comment on the same gap, and the top-level `Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md`'s "Scheduled
       cloud routines" section for the closest existing precedent, which only reads this repo's
       *code*, not live task data). A background agent that could check for spikes without
       anyone's tab open would need that credential set up first — a real, one-time infrastructure
       step with its own security review, not something to add casually alongside a reactive
       in-app rule like this one.
   - **Three more automations from the same shortlist** (asked for by name: "what other agents can
     I build for PM?" → "build the first 3"), wired into the exact same `tasks` `onSnapshot`
     handler right after `checkWorkloadSpikes()`. All three share its shape: a session-local
     `xWarned` dedup map keyed so a materially different situation (a new deadline, a fresh
     `updatedAt`) re-notifies while an unchanged one only fires once per session, and a plain
     `notifications` collection write via `setDoc(doc(notificationsCol), {...})`.
     - **`systemAlertHeadline(type)` is the one place all four system alerts' wording lives** —
       a plain-language headline per type ("Your workload is stacking up" / "A deadline is coming
       up" / "Still waiting on a review" / "A deadline clashes with your time off"), shared
       verbatim between the bell panel's bold line and the desktop popup's title. First shipped as
       `author: 'Workload alert'`/`'Deadline alert'`/etc. forced through the normal "`<author>`
       verb subject" template (e.g. "Deadline alert flagged an approaching deadline on 'Pitch
       Deck'") — reported back directly, from a screenshot, as reading clinical and repetitive:
       that headline named the task, and the detail line right below it (`snippet`) named the
       exact same task again. `systemAlertHeadline` returns `null` for every non-system type, so
       both call sites fall through to the original person-did-something-to-a-thing template
       unchanged for comments/mentions/chat/assignment. The specific detail (which task, which
       date) lives in `snippet` alone now — softened at the same time ("has been waiting on a
       review for" instead of "sitting in"; "while you're away" instead of "marked away"; "You
       have N tasks" instead of a bare count) — so the headline and detail line no longer say the
       same thing twice.
     - **Deadline-approaching reminder** (`checkDeadlineReminders`, `type: 'deadline_reminder'`) —
       the gap this fills: overdue is already visible everywhere (Board badges, Focus of the Day,
       the digest panel), but nothing proactively flags a deadline that's *about* to arrive.
       Fires once per task while `daysUntil(deadline)` is 0–2 (`DEADLINE_REMINDER_DAYS = 2`),
       excluding Done and — same exemption as `dueUrgency`/`renderFocus` — Review, since a task
       sent off for review isn't running on the assignee's own clock anymore.
     - **Stale-in-Review nudge** (`checkStaleReviews`, `type: 'review_stale'`) — nothing currently
       flags a task that's been sitting in Review with no follow-up. Uses `updatedAt` as a proxy
       for "since this task last saw activity while in Review" (there's no dedicated
       `enteredReviewAt` field) — an approximation, same spirit as the digest panel's own
       documented "Done" ≠ "recently completed" shortcut: an unrelated edit resets the clock
       without a real review action happening. Confirmed comments don't reset it before relying on
       this — the comment-save path writes only `{ comments: list }`, never touching `updatedAt` —
       so a reviewer's own feedback can't quietly suppress the next nudge. Fires at
       `REVIEW_STALE_DAYS = 3` days. Notifies the *assignee*, not "the reviewer": this app has no
       separate reviewer-identity field (`reviewAudience` is a Client/Internal label, not a
       person), so the assignee — who put it in Review and is the one who'd actually chase a
       stalled sign-off — is the useful recipient.
     - **Leave-conflict warning** (`checkLeaveClashes`, `type: 'leave_clash'`) — reuses
       `isOnLeave(assignee, deadline)` completely unchanged, the same "deadline lands ON a day
       the assignee is away" signal the Gantt's own `gantt-leave-note` already validated (see
       "Personal leave" elsewhere in this file: date-*range* overlap was tried and rejected there
       as normal/noisy — a task merely spanning someone's time off resolves itself; a deadline
       landing while they're actually away doesn't). This just turns that same passive Gantt
       signal into a notification reaching the affected assignee directly. Doesn't touch leave
       *editing* at all — `canEditLeaveFor` (self-or-admin, matching the `people` collection's
       Firestore rule) is unchanged; this only reads existing leave data.
     - **Fixed: all four re-notified once per deploy** — reported directly, from a screenshot of
       the same "A deadline is coming up" alert repeated six times in the bell panel, which lined
       up exactly with six deploys shipped that session. Root cause: each automation's `xWarned`
       map (`workloadSpikeWarned`/`deadlineReminderWarned`/`reviewStaleWarned`/`leaveClashWarned`)
       is in-memory only, so it reset on every page reload — but the underlying condition (a task
       still due in 0-2 days, say) didn't, and this app auto-reloads on every new deploy (see
       "Established patterns" in the top-level `CLAUDE.md`), so anyone with the app open across
       several releases got re-notified about the same still-open thing once per release. Not a
       one-off dev-session artifact: it would recur for a real user on any normal day with more
       than one deploy.
       - **Fix: a new `notificationDedup` collection**, one doc per task id, holding whichever of
         `deadlineReminderFor`/`reviewStaleFor`/`leaveClashFor`/`workloadSpikeFor` apply — each
         storing the exact value (`deadline`, `updatedAt`, or a cluster signature) the original
         in-memory key was built from, so "already sent for this value" survives a reload the
         same way the value itself would need to change for a fresh notification either way.
         Loaded into `notificationDedupByTaskId` via its own `onSnapshot` alongside `unsubPeople`/
         `unsubProjects`; each `xWarned` map is kept too, as the fast same-render short-circuit,
         so a single render doesn't round-trip through this map's data more than once per task.
       - **Deliberately its own collection, not new fields on `tasks`** — writing this
         bookkeeping onto the task doc itself would hit the ownership-scoped `tasks` update rule
         (see "Who can edit what" below): the person whose client happens to run the check is very
         often not the task's creator, exactly the same reasoning `checkWorkloadSpikes` already
         gives for not scoping itself to "the current viewer." `notificationDedup` is whole-team
         read/write instead, same shape as the existing `projectTyping` collection — this is
         automation bookkeeping, not task content, so it doesn't need per-owner scoping at all.
       - **`checkWorkloadSpikes` stamps every task in a cluster**, not just one, with the same
         cluster signature (`deadline|sorted-task-ids`) — a later check only treats the cluster as
         already-handled if *every* member carries that exact signature, so a task joining an
         existing cluster (a materially different pile-up, same as the original in-memory key's
         own reasoning) still triggers a fresh notification even though its cluster-mates were
         already stamped from before.
       - **Known limit, accepted**: `notificationDedup` docs are never pruned when a task is
         archived or deleted, so the collection grows by one small doc per task forever — the same
         trade-off this file already accepts for the `activity` log, at a scale (one team's worth
         of tasks) where it doesn't matter in practice.
     - **Fixed again: the persisted layer above didn't actually work, and the duplicates came
       straight back.** Reported a second time, from a screenshot of "A deadline is coming up"
       three times over for one task and three more for another. Two separate races, both closed
       by `runTaskAutomations()`:
       - **The dedup map was read before its own listener had delivered anything.**
         `unsubNotificationDedup` and `unsubTasks` are attached together in `startListeners`, and
         the tasks snapshot routinely resolves first — so on every cold load the four checks read
         an empty `notificationDedupByTaskId`, concluded nothing had ever been sent, and sent it
         all again. The in-memory `xWarned` map then suppressed any repeat for the rest of that
         session, which is exactly why it looked like "once per reload" both times. **The comment
         on that listener explicitly called this window a "minor, accepted inaccuracy" — it was
         not minor; it defeated the entire persisted layer on the only path that layer existed
         for.** All four checks now run only through `runTaskAutomations()`, which returns early
         unless `notificationDedupReady` is true, and the dedup listener calls it itself once its
         first snapshot lands — so whichever listener finishes *second* is the one that runs them,
         with both halves of the data present.
       - **Every teammate's browser was racing to send the same alert.** These checks scan the
         whole board (`activeTasks()`, deliberately not filtered — see `checkWorkloadSpikes`'
         own note), and all four notify the task's *assignee*, so N open sessions each decided
         independently to send the same notification. The persisted dedup can't help here: it
         only suppresses a repeat once somebody's write has already landed, which is no use when
         everyone checks at the same moment. **`isOwnNotification(recipientName)` now gates all
         four** — a browser only ever evaluates alerts addressed to the person using it, so
         exactly one client can generate a given alert. The trade: an alert is created when its
         recipient next has the app open, rather than by whoever happens to be online first.
         That costs nothing in practice — these are in-app notifications, and the desktop popup
         already required the recipient's own tab to be open.
       - **On a listener error, `notificationDedupReady` deliberately stays false and all four
         automations stay silent.** The most likely cause of that error is `notificationDedup`'s
         `firestore.rules` block never having been deployed (rules don't ship with the site —
         see the top-level `CLAUDE.md`), and with no way to know what's already been sent,
         sending nothing beats re-sending everything on every reload. **If these alerts ever go
         completely quiet, check the browser console for `notificationDedup listener error`
         before assuming the automations themselves broke.**
   - **Filters persist across reloads** (`FILTERS_KEY = 'flowboard_filters'`, `loadFilters`/
     `persistFilters`/`restoreFilterControls`). Only the five known keys are read back, so a
     stale or hand-edited `localStorage` value can't inject anything else. Safe to persist
     precisely *because* every active filter already renders as a visible pill next to a Clear
     button — there is no hidden state to be surprised by, which is the usual objection to
     remembering a filter. At five people the unfiltered board fit on one screen and re-narrowing
     it each session cost nothing; at eleven it's the first thing everyone does on every visit.
     - **`reconcileFilters()` runs from the `tasks` `onSnapshot` handler, not from a renderer**,
       and this placement is the whole trick. A restored filter naming a project or person who
       has since left the board has to be dropped — left active it hides every task with no pill
       on screen explaining why and nothing to click to clear. But the first `renderAll()` fires
       at `init()` while `tasks` is still `[]` waiting on the first snapshot, so doing this check
       in `renderFilterOptions` would clear *every* persisted filter on every load. The snapshot
       handler is the one moment the set of real projects/people actually changes and the only
       point at which `tasks` is known to be loaded. `renderFilterOptions` now reads `filters` as
       its source of truth (not the select's own value, which is empty on a fresh load) and only
       *displays*.
     - `restoreFilterControls()` (called first in `init()`) pushes the persisted values back into
       search/priority/sort only. The project select has no options yet at init time (and the
       people filter has no roster yet either); `renderFilterOptions` restores those.
     - **The people filter (`filters.assignees`) is a checkbox multi-select, not the single-value
       `<select>` it used to be** — requested directly, framed as "subscribing to calendars":
       pick any number of people whose schedule/workload to see, not one at a time. Built as its
       own `#filter-people-trigger`/`#filter-people-menu` pair (not another `enhanceSelect()`
       instance, which only ever drives one value) but registered into the same
       `allEnhancedSelects` array those use, so it gets "closes on outside click / Escape / when
       another header panel opens" for free from the existing generic handlers instead of a
       second copy of that logic. `renderPeopleFilterList()` (called from `renderFilterOptions`)
       rebuilds the checkbox list from `teamRoster()` — **the roster, not `uniqueValues('assignee')`**
       — on purpose: someone with zero current tasks is still a real person to pre-subscribe to
       before they have any, which a tasks-derived list would never offer. `reconcileFilters()`
       validates persisted names against the same `teamRoster()` list.
       - **Two things were decided rather than assumed, both kept at the safer/more-consistent
         default:** nobody checked still means "show everyone" (matches the old filter's empty
         state — an opt-in-only "nothing shows until you subscribe" reading of the calendar
         metaphor was considered and rejected as too easy to load into a confusing empty board);
         and it applies to the same four views the old single-select touched (Board/Gantt/
         Calendar/People), not narrowed to just Gantt/People, so the app has one filtering
         behavior everywhere instead of two.
       - `loadFilters()` migrates the old persisted single `assignee` string into a one-item
         `assignees` array, so someone's existing narrowed view survives the upgrade instead of
         silently resetting to Everyone.
       - **`DEFAULT_FILTERS.assignees` is a literal `[]` that must never be handed out as-is.**
         `Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_FILTERS)` only shallow-copies, so every consumer (the
         `loadFilters()` catch-all, the Clear-filters handler) explicitly overrides `assignees`
         with its own fresh `[]` — sharing the template's array would let one caller's
         `push()`/`splice()` corrupt the default for every other caller in the same page load.
   - `filters.search` (the search box, `#filter-search`) matches name/project/assignee plus
     checklist-item text and comment text (`applyFilters`) — wired into **Board, Gantt, Calendar and
     People**, the four views listed in `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS`. Projects/Suggestions
     don't route through it. **Archived is searchable too, on request**: `renderArchived` calls the
     shared `taskMatchesSearch(t, q)` (the same matcher `applyFilters` uses, so the two cannot
     disagree) and deliberately applies *only* the search, not teamspace or the dropdowns, which
     never applied to that list. (An earlier version of this note also excluded Calendar; that stopped
     being true once `renderCalendar` started calling `applyFilters` and the note wasn't updated —
     if you change which views filter, change `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS` and this line together.)
     - **People and Projects also match the person/project itself, not only tasks** (asked for
       directly: "make search bar applicable to projects and people"). People: a roster member whose
       name or department label matches shows with *all* their work (`applyFilters(list, true)`
       skips the search term for their rows), including someone with no tasks; with priority/
       project also set they still need work under those. Projects (now in `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS`): a
       name match shows the whole card; otherwise a project shows if any active or archived task
       matches `taskMatchesSearch`, listing only those rows, while the card's totals stay
       project-wide. Projects still ignores the priority/project/people dropdowns, as before.
     - **Activity is searchable too, and it is the one entry in `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS` that does not
       route through `applyFilters()`.** `renderActivityFeed` runs its own match over the summary
       line and the person, because an activity row is not a task — the priority/project/assignee
       filters describe tasks, and silently applying them to a log of "X renamed Y" entries would
       hide rows for reasons the row itself never displays. `syncSearchAvailability()` swaps the
       placeholder to "Search activity…" there so the box doesn't promise checklist/comment search
       it isn't doing on that view.
     - **The box disables itself on the views it doesn't affect.** `syncSearchAvailability()`, called
       from `setView`, sets `disabled`, swaps the placeholder to "Search doesn't apply here", adds a
       tooltip naming the view, and dims it. Previously the box stayed fully enabled everywhere, so
       typing on Archived changed nothing and read as "there is no such task in the archive" — a
       wrong answer rather than no answer. If you make another view searchable, add it to
       `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS` and it picks this up automatically.
     - **The Sort dropdown had the same gap, reported directly as "sorting isn't working" on
       Activity and Projects.** Neither ever read `filters.sortBy`: Projects always sorts Ongoing
       by soonest deadline and Completed by most recently archived (one true order, not a user
       choice), and Activity is a chronological log with no priority/deadline/project fields to
       sort by in the first place. Projects gets the same disable-with-a-reason treatment as
       search (`SORT_DISABLED_VIEWS`, `syncSortAvailability()`) — `enhanceSelect()` gained a
       `setDisabled()` method for this (`sort-by` needed one, `search` didn't: the real `<select>`
       is `sr-only` and out of tab order, so disabling it alone would have left the visible
       trigger button — the thing clicks and Tab actually reach — fully clickable while merely
       looking disabled; `.disabled` has to go on both elements).
       - **Activity briefly got a real Newest/Oldest-first sort instead of a disable** (a
         separate `filters.activitySort` field, its own `<option>` list swapped into the live
         `<select>` per view), reasoning that "newest first" is a meaningful choice for a log even
         though it isn't the same choice a task list offers. Shipped, then reported back on a
         direct follow-up as not wanted on that page at all — pulled entirely rather than left as
         a working-but-unwanted feature: no `activitySort` field, no option-swapping,
         `renderActivityFeed` back to the log's natural (already newest-first) query order. Sort
         is simply in `SORT_DISABLED_VIEWS` alongside Projects now — the difference is Activity
         also hides the control outright (see `ACTIVITY_HIDDEN_FILTER_WRAP_IDS` below) rather
         than leaving it greyed out the way Projects' Sort still is.
     - **Priority/Project/People are hidden outright on Activity, not just left inert.** Same
       "control present, wired to nothing" gap as search/sort above — `renderActivityFeed`
       already had its own comment explaining why these three don't apply (an activity row isn't
       a task). Reported directly once they sat there fully clickable and doing nothing.
       `syncToolbarLayout()`, called alongside `syncSearchAvailability()`/`syncSortAvailability()`
       from `setView()`, toggles `.hidden` on `ACTIVITY_HIDDEN_FILTER_WRAP_IDS` (`filter-priority-
       wrap`/`filter-project-wrap`/`filter-people-wrap`/`sort-by-wrap`) and switches `#toolbar-row`
       from `justify-end` to `justify-center` — with only Search left standing on that view, a
       right-hugging row would read as "most of a toolbar went missing" rather than intentional.
   - **Task dependencies were removed** (they shipped in `7ca02d4` and were taken out again).
     The whole editor is gone: the modal's Dependencies section, `wouldCreateCycle`,
     `renderDependenciesEditor`, `addDependency`, `currentTasksForDeps`, the board card's amber
     `BLOCKED` badge, and the activity-log diff line. **Don't rebuild it without asking** — it was
     cut deliberately, not lost.
     - `dependsOn` is still **read on load and passed straight back through on save**
       (`currentDependsOn`, a plain variable with no editor attached), so a task saved while the
       feature existed doesn't get the field wiped by a routine edit. Same "removed from the UI,
       kept in the data" approach as the Tasks checklist in the sibling Content Hub. It's also
       still sanitised on Import so an export/import round-trip preserves it.
     - In practice there is probably no `dependsOn` data at all: the feature only existed between
       `7ca02d4` and its removal, and that same commit shipped a syntax error that made the whole
       app fail to load, so nobody could have used it. The round-trip is cheap insurance, not a
       response to known data.
   - **This Week digest** (`btn-digest`/`digest-panel`, `renderDigestPanel`): a bell-and-dropdown
     icon next to the notification bell, same interaction pattern, scoped to the signed-in
     viewer's own tasks (`t.assignee === myName`) — Overdue, Due in the next 7 days, and
     "Recently completed" (still really "currently `status === 'Done'`," even though a real
     `completedAt` timestamp exists now — see "Completion motivators" below; this list wasn't
     switched to it, see the comment above `renderDigestPanel` for why). Deliberately in-app
     rather than emailed/Slacked: no connector for either exists yet, and this needed no new
     integration to ship. Called from `renderAll()` so it stays in sync with every task change
     like every other view.
   - **Completion motivators** (`renderBoard`, `boardTaskRowHtml`, `updateTaskStatus`,
     `statusTransitionEffects`) — three small, deliberately-scoped-down pieces addressing "moving
     a card into Done should feel rewarding," built after a toast-per-task-move idea was rejected
     in conversation for fatigue risk on a busy shared board:
     - A `completedAt` timestamp is now stamped on every task the moment it enters `Done`, and
       cleared if it's moved back out — the first real completion timestamp this app has had
       (`archivedAt` is a separate, later, manual action). Existing Done tasks from before this
       shipped simply have no `completedAt` and don't retroactively gain one — same fix-it-forward
       approach as the checklist item id backfill.
       - **`statusTransitionEffects(taskId, taskProject, oldStatus, newStatus)` is the one place
         that decides `completedAt`, the pulse flag, and whether a project just finished** — both
         `updateTaskStatus` (Board drag-and-drop) and the task-modal save handler call it. It
         didn't start that way: this logic first shipped living directly inside
         `updateTaskStatus`, so changing a task's Status dropdown in the modal and clicking Save
         silently skipped all of it (no `completedAt`, no pulse, no confetti) — that path writes
         through its own `setDoc` call, never through `updateTaskStatus`. Reported directly
         ("the confetti doesn't appear when status is changed to completed in the card"), fixed by
         extracting the shared helper rather than duplicating the logic a second time. Takes
         `oldStatus` as a plain value, not an old-task object, specifically so a brand-new task
         saved with `status: 'Done'` on first creation (no old task to diff against) still counts
         as "entering Done" — `oldStatus` is `null` in that case, and `null !== 'Done'` is true.
     - **Card pulse**: a card that just moved into Done gets a one-shot pulse animation
       (`task-just-completed` / `task-complete-pop`). The pulse flag (`justCompletedIds`, id →
       timestamp, TTL ~3.5s) is set **eagerly in `statusTransitionEffects` before the Firestore
       write goes out**, not inside a `.then()` — the `onSnapshot`-driven re-render that actually
       paints the card in its new column can land before the write's own promise resolves, and
       setting the flag too late means the pulse silently never shows.
       - **The green "this is done" signal lives on the row (`boardTaskRowHtml`'s `rowBg`), not
         the column.** It briefly lived on the column too (an emerald tint on the Done column's
         header/background) — reverted after feedback that tinting the whole column on top of
         already-green cards was too much at once. A Done task's row now gets an actual
         background wash (`bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-500/10`), so the signal is visible
         regardless of which project card it's sitting in. The Done column's header keeps its
         small emerald "N today" pill (a status readout, not a column-wide tint) and its neutral
         zinc background/border, same as every other column.
     - **"N today" badge**: the Done column header shows a count of tasks with `completedAt` on
       today's local date (`completedTodayCount`, via the existing `localDateOf` helper — not a
       raw UTC slice, for the same reason `localDateOf` exists elsewhere). It bounces
       (`done-today-bounce`) only on the render where the count just increased
       (`lastDoneTodayCount`, module-scoped) — not on page load, and not on an unrelated re-render
       from someone else's edit landing via `onSnapshot`.
     - **Confetti fires on every single task completion**, not just whole-project completion —
       `statusTransitionEffects` returns `enteringDone` alongside `willFinishProject`, and both
       call sites (`updateTaskStatus` for Board drag-and-drop, `commitTaskSave` for the modal)
       call bare `spawnConfetti()` whenever a task enters `Done` and isn't the project-finishing
       task. Originally confetti was scoped to whole-project completion only; reported directly
       ("have it per task") as too rare to feel like a reward for everyday task completion.
     - **Whole-project celebration** stays a separate, rarer case worth an actual toast — every
       active task in a project now `Done`. `updateTaskStatus`/`commitTaskSave` check this
       synchronously against the current `tasks` state before the write (same reasoning as the
       pulse flag), and fire `celebrateProjectComplete` instead of the bare per-task confetti —
       a new `'celebrate'` `showToast` type (sparkle icon, longer 5.2s dwell) plus its own
       `spawnConfetti()` call, so a failed write can't produce a false "project complete"
       celebration (the `if (willFinishProject) ... else if (enteringDone) ...` branching at both
       call sites means a project-finishing task gets the special toast+confetti, never a double
       burst of confetti on top of it). This is deliberately independent of
       `checkProjectDeadlinePopups`'s existing archive-prompt, which is gated on the project's
       *deadline* having passed, not on the moment every task actually finishes — both can fire
       for the same project, at different times, for different reasons.
       - `spawnConfetti()` spawns 90 `.confetti-piece` divs (bumped up from an original 28, which
         read as sparse/underwhelming once per-task completion made the burst a far more frequent
         sight — reported directly). On-brand palette (orange wordmark, emerald Done, plus the
         amber/violet already used for overtime/due-soon — not a generic rainbow), each piece
         animated via CSS custom properties set per-element (`--confetti-rot`/`--confetti-drift`
         for fall rotation/drift, `--confetti-w`/`--confetti-h` for a randomized size between
         small flecks and bigger ribbons — a fixed 8×14px rectangle repeated 28 times is what
         made the original burst read as flat/sparse even though every piece animated correctly)
         so one shared `@keyframes confetti-fall` and one shared `.confetti-piece` rule still
         give every piece its own look, then removed via `setTimeout`.
         **`removeConfettiPiece(el)` is a named, parameterized closure factory, not an inline
         `function () { piece.remove(); }` inside the loop** — `var piece` is one shared binding
         across all 90 loop iterations, so an inline closure would have every timeout firing
         against whichever piece the loop landed on *last*, leaking the rest permanently.
         Checks `prefers-reduced-motion` itself and skips creating any elements at all rather
         than the CSS-level `animation: none` override used for the pulse/bounce above — a
         confetti piece that can't fall is just a stray colored rectangle sitting on screen for
         two seconds, which reads as a bug, not a design choice.
     - All the new CSS animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (no existing animation in this
       app did before this — Flowboard didn't have the guard the sibling apps already use, until
       now).
     - **Not verified in a live browser this round** — this environment has no Firebase CLI /
       emulator installed, and the app is `type="module"` (unlike the sibling MS Creatives, its
       state isn't reachable from `window.*` for a Playwright smoke test either). Verified via
       `node scripts/check-syntax.mjs` and a careful manual re-read of the diff only. Worth an
       emulator-backed pass before/after the next deploy if anything here looks off in practice.
   - **Review audience** (`reviewAudience` field, `promptReviewAudience`, `reviewAudienceBadgeHtml`)
     — a task entering the Review column gets asked whether the review is for the client or
     internal, and the answer shows as a label on its Board card for as long as it stays there.
     Requested directly, then a direct follow-up ("make it editable as well") turned the label
     from a one-time stamp into something you can click to change your mind.
     - **`promptReviewAudience(onChoose)` reuses the confirm modal instead of building a second
       one** — it already has two independently-labeled buttons (`confirmText`/`cancelText`) plus
       an `onCancel` callback, which is exactly a two-choice prompt's shape. "Cancel" here is a
       real equal choice ("Internal review"), not an abort: dismissing via backdrop click or
       Escape calls neither callback, so `onChoose` simply never fires and whatever
       `reviewAudience` already had (usually nothing, for a fresh move into Review) is left
       alone — asking never forces an answer.
     - **Three separate triggers, all funneling into the same `promptReviewAudience`:**
       (1) dropping a card onto the Review column on the Board — fires *after* `updateTaskStatus`
       completes the move, not before, so the drop itself never waits on a modal decision, then a
       follow-up bare `updateDoc({ reviewAudience })`; (2) flipping the task modal's Status
       dropdown to Review — a `change` listener on `#task-status` prompts immediately and stashes
       the answer in `pendingReviewAudience` (a module var, since Save can't itself await an async
       modal choice), read back into `taskData` at save time; (3) clicking the card's own label,
       any time, via `data-set-review-audience` in the global click delegation — checked *before*
       `data-open-task` there, so clicking the label re-prompts instead of opening the full task
       modal underneath it.
     - **Clearing is centralized in `statusTransitionEffects`, not duplicated at each call
       site** — `if (newStatus !== 'Review' && oldStatus === 'Review') patch.reviewAudience =
       null`, same shared-helper pattern `completedAt` already uses for entering/leaving Done. A
       card leaving Review and coming back later starts blank again rather than silently
       reusing a stale answer nobody just gave.
     - **`openTaskModal()` only carries `pendingReviewAudience` forward when the task being
       opened is *already* in Review** (`task.status === 'Review' ? (task.reviewAudience ||
       null) : null`) — editing a Pipeline task doesn't inherit a leftover value from whatever
       task the modal last had open, and the dropdown's `change` event only fires on an actual
       user interaction, not on `openTaskModal()` setting the initial value — so opening an
       existing Review task and clicking Save without touching Status never re-prompts.
     - **`reviewAudience` is deliberately NOT in `tasks`' `update` rule carve-out** — restricted
       to the assignee or an admin, on request (a first pass briefly opened it to the whole team,
       matching `status`'s own carve-out, before being asked to keep it assignee/admin-only).
       Anyone can still drag a task into Review (that write is just `status`/`completedAt`/
       `updatedAt`, already in the carve-out); the follow-up prompt asking who the review is for
       only actually saves if the person dragging is the assignee or an admin. Since the intended
       restriction was already what the live rules enforced (the brief wider-open version was
       only ever committed, never deployed — see "Firestore rules/index deploys are separate from
       shipping the site" in the top-level `CLAUDE.md`), reverting it in the repo needed no
       redeploy to take effect.
     - **The two write paths handle a permission denial differently, on purpose.** The
       click-to-edit badge (`data-set-review-audience`) surfaces `writeErrorMessage(err, task)` —
       the same assignee-or-admin explanation every other restricted task edit in this app already
       gives — because clicking the label is a deliberate act someone should get real feedback on.
       The drag-and-drop follow-up swallows its error silently instead: dragging a card into
       Review is open to the whole team, so a teammate who isn't the assignee gets asked the
       question and then has the answer quietly rejected *every single time they drag anything
       into Review* — an error toast there would be near-constant noise for an outcome that was
       never really their permission to have in the first place. The assignee or an admin can
       always set it properly afterward via the label itself.
     - **This restriction lived through a brief fully-open interlude and is fully back now, just
       creator-scoped instead of assignee-scoped.** Task `update` was briefly open to the whole
       team (see "Who can edit what (ownership rules)" further down for the full history), during
       which both write paths above simply succeeded for anyone and the two differently-handled
       denial paths right below did nothing. That interlude ended — `reviewAudience` again falls
       back to the general ownership check (now creator-or-admin-or-legacy-assignee, not
       assignee-or-admin) since it isn't in the update rule's comments/status carve-out. The
       "swallow vs. surface" split immediately below is live again for real denials.
     - **Two colors, deliberately not reused from anywhere else that colors a Board card**: blue
       for Client, zinc for Internal. Every other status/priority hue already means something
       specific on this exact row (rose/amber/sky = High/Medium/Low, purple = ready-for-review,
       emerald = Done) or on the project badge above it (the orange/teal/indigo/fuchsia/cyan/
       lime/pink/violet hash palette) — reusing any of those here would have read as a second,
       false signal riding along with the real one.
     - **The badge sits last in the meta row with `ml-auto`, not right after Priority.** First
       shipped next to Priority; reported directly that this crowded the row's left side while
       the rest of it (past the date/time icons) sat empty. Moving it to the end and giving it
       `ml-auto` pushes just that one badge to the row's right edge without disturbing the
       left-packed order of Priority/date/time/overdue before it.
   - **Project group chat** (`#view-chat`, `selectChatProject`, `renderChatView`,
     `renderChatDetail`) — a dedicated message thread + pinned-links list per project, requested
     directly as "something equivalent to a WhatsApp/Google Chat group" for housing a project's
     links, images and conversation in one place, separate from task comments.
     - **A standalone sidebar tab, not a modal** — shipped first as a modal opened from the
       Projects tab, then reported directly ("the chat should be a standalone tab") and rebuilt.
       `data-view-btn="chat"` sits in the sidebar nav right after Projects, with its own
       `messageCircle` icon (a rounded speech bubble) — deliberately not the rectangular
       `message` icon Suggestions already uses one row below it, which would have made the two
       indistinguishable at a glance. The view itself is a two-pane layout: `#chat-project-list`
       on the left (every project, whether or not it has a chat yet), the selected project's
       thread in `#chat-detail` on the right, with `#chat-empty-state` shown until something's
       selected. `renderChatView()` is this tab's renderer, wired into
       `renderCurrentSecondaryView()` like every other view; `TOOLBAR_HIDDEN_FILTER_VIEWS` (the
       generalized form of what used to be Activity-only hiding logic) hides the Priority/
       Project/People/Sort dropdowns on Chat too, for the same reason Activity hides them — none
       of the four describe a project list any more than they describe an activity log.
     - **The project list column is drag-to-resize** (`#chat-list-resize-handle`,
       `applyChatListWidth`) — reported directly against a screenshot where several project
       names ("271231[LittlePaddington]MarketingAgencyPartner2026…") were truncating past
       usefulness in the fixed `w-64` column. This team's project-naming convention embeds a
       long, space-free date/client/campaign string, so no single fixed width reads every name
       without truncating *something* — letting people widen the column themselves beats
       guessing one width that works for every project on the board. Persisted to
       `localStorage` (`flowboard_chat_list_width`), same as `filters` — a personal display
       preference, not shared team state, so it isn't written to Firestore. Only active at the
       `lg` breakpoint the two-column layout exists at (`matchMedia('(min-width: 1024px)')`);
       below that the panes stack and the handle is hidden, since there's nothing to drag between.
       - **The max width is relative (`chatListMaxWidth()`, half of `#chat-panes-row`'s own
         width), not a fixed pixel ceiling** — first shipped as a flat 440px cap, reported back
         directly as too restrictive ("make the width extendable to up to 50% of the space
         allowed"). `applyChatListWidth()` re-clamps against the current cap on every call, not
         just at drag-time (via a debounced `resize` listener too), so a width saved on a wide
         monitor doesn't strand the detail pane too narrow after the browser window itself
         shrinks.
     - **The shared confirm modal (`#confirm-title`/`#confirm-body`) didn't wrap a long,
       space-free string — it overflowed past the modal's edge instead**, surfaced by the same
       long project name above landing in the "Create a group chat for…" confirm. Plain CSS text
       wrapping only breaks at spaces; a single unbroken token wider than the modal (`max-w-sm`)
       had nowhere to break, so it just ran past the `overflow-hidden` edge and got clipped. Fixed
       with `break-words` (`overflow-wrap: break-word`) on both elements — a general fix to the
       shared component, not a chat-specific one, since `openConfirm` is reused for archive/
       delete/etc. confirmations elsewhere that insert task or project names the same way and
       were equally exposed to this, just not yet hit by a name long enough to show it.
     - **Focus of the Day's card had the same overflow, a third place this naming convention
       exposed the same class of bug** — its project-name line had no `truncate` at all
       (`renderFocus`'s card template), so a long project name ran past the card's rounded border
       into the empty space of whatever sat next to it, worse than the confirm modal's version
       since there wasn't even an `overflow-hidden` boundary to stop at. Fixed with `truncate`
       (ellipsis, matching how the chat project list already handles this) plus the same
       `data-tooltip`/`tooltip-top` pair the card's task-name line above it already uses, so the
       full name is still reachable on hover. Worth checking any other place a project or task
       name renders as a bare `<p>`/`<span>` with no `truncate`/`break-words` for the same latent
       bug — this convention's names are unusually good at finding rendering assumptions that
       held for ordinary "Word Word Word" names.
     - **The pinned-link "Label" input was too narrow to read anything typed into it**
       (`w-28` → `w-44`) — reported directly against a screenshot.
     - **"Pinned links" recolored from brand-orange to emerald** (the "+ Add" toggle and each
       link's own anchor text) — reported directly ("change pinned links to green instead of
       orange"). Deliberately this app's existing `emerald` (the same green already used for
       Done/success states), not a new shade, and scoped to just this one section — links/mentions
       everywhere else in chat (message text, the compose box, "New chat") stay brand-orange like
       every other actionable link in this app. Distinct from "Pinned messages" (added
       separately, further down), which stayed amber — the two sections now read as two visually
       distinct colors rather than needing the "links" vs. "messages" word to tell them apart.
     - **Manual, not automatic on a project's first task** — explicitly called out by the user
       mid-build ("this is something to be created manually and not automatically when a user
       creates a task"). Most projects never need a dedicated thread, so `projectCardHtml`'s card
       button and the Chat tab's own "New chat" picker (below) both funnel into the same
       `openConfirm` → `createProjectChat` flow. `Array.isArray(projectDoc.chat)` is the one
       signal a chat exists — no separate boolean flag to keep in sync with it.
     - **`#chat-project-list` only lists projects that already have a chat** — reported directly
       ("if no chat is created, it should not be listed"). It first shipped listing *every*
       project on the board, with a "no chat yet" placeholder row doubling as the create
       affordance; creating one now lives entirely behind an explicit **"New chat"** button
       (`#chat-new-btn`/`#chat-new-menu`, `renderNewChatMenu`) — a small dropdown of exactly the
       complementary set (projects *without* a chat), each option opening the same create-confirm
       `projectCardHtml`'s own button already used. `allProjectNames()` factors out the "every
       project name on the board" query both the list and the picker need the complementary
       halves of. The empty states are worded differently on purpose: "No group chats yet — use
       'New chat' above" (nothing created at all) vs. "Every active project already has a chat."
       / "No active projects on the board." inside the picker itself (nothing *left* to create
       one for) — conflating these would tell someone to click a button that can't actually help
       them.
       - **Only "on the board" projects are offered** (`!isProjectFullyArchived(name)`, the same
         Ongoing/Completed definition `renderProjects` uses) — reported directly after a fully
         archived, wrapped-up project showed up as a "New chat" candidate alongside active ones.
         Starting a fresh conversation for something already finished and archived isn't a real
         use case; this only narrows what "New chat" can start, not what the main list already
         shows — an archived project's *existing* chat (with its own "Completed" tag) still
         appears there untouched.
       - **`#chat-new-menu` is `position: fixed`, computed from the button's own rect on open, not
         an absolutely-positioned child of `#chat-project-list-pane`** — it originally was, and
         got silently clipped by that pane's own `overflow-hidden` (needed for the rounded corners
         and the scrolling list beneath it) the moment a project name was long enough to need the
         wider width below to show. Reported directly against a screenshot. Same fix, and the same
         underlying reason, as `#chat-reaction-picker` a few sections up — a dropdown anchored
         inside any `overflow-hidden` ancestor will eventually clip once its content is wide
         enough, so it has to live outside that ancestor in the DOM and be positioned in viewport
         coordinates instead of document-flow ones.
       - **Option labels wrap (`whitespace-normal break-words`) instead of truncating** —
         reported directly ("the dropdown should expand so the entire title can be seen"). The
         menu's own `max-w-[24rem]` caps how wide any single long name can force the dropdown
         before wrapping takes over, so one very long project name can't blow the picker out to
         an unreasonable width on screen.
     - **Search and a "My chats" filter, both requested directly** — `chat` joined
       `SEARCHABLE_VIEWS` (custom placeholder "Search chats…", same pattern Activity already
       uses for its own non-`applyFilters()` search) and `renderChatProjectList` matches
       `filters.search` against project names. "My chats" (`chatShowMineOnly`, a plain
       session-local toggle button, not persisted — a quick narrow-down while looking, not a
       standing preference like the board filters) was read literally: "chats I am involved in"
       means chats this person has actually **posted in** (`pdoc.chat.some(m => m.author ===
       myName)`), not merely projects they're assigned a task in — those are different
       relationships and the literal one is what was asked for. Both compose with each other
       (search AND My-chats can be active together), and the empty-state message names whichever
       combination produced zero results rather than a generic "no chats."
     - **@mention autocomplete didn't exist in the chat compose box at all** — reported directly
       ("tagging people in the chat does not seem to work"). A manually-typed exact
       `@FullName` would still have highlighted and notified correctly (chat messages already ran
       through the same `parseMentions`/`enrichCommentText` task comments use), but with no
       discoverable `@` menu, nobody would think to try typing a name out in full. The task
       comment box's own autocomplete was hardwired to one specific input/menu pair
       (`mentionInput`/`mentionMenu` module vars); generalized into `wireMentionAutocomplete
       (inputEl, menuEl)` — same name and shape as the sibling Content Hub's own function of the
       same purpose, which had already generalized this before Flowboard did — and instantiated
       twice: once for `#task-comment-input`/`#mention-menu` (unchanged behavior), once for the
       new `#project-chat-input`/`#project-chat-mention-menu`. Each caller holds its own returned
       `{close}` handle rather than sharing one global `closeMentionMenu()`, so sending a chat
       message can't accidentally leave the *task* comment box's menu in a stale state or
       vice versa.
     - **Deleting a message vs. deleting the whole chat — asked for directly, with an explicit
       permission split, refined once more on a direct follow-up.** First pass: "delete a single
       message yes. Delete entire project should only be available for admin." Second pass, once
       single-message delete had shipped: "should only apply to your own message. Not to
       others." Three tiers now, not two:
       - **Your own message** (`removeChatMessage`, the `x` on each message next to its
         timestamp) — `chatMessageHtml` only ever renders that button when `m.author === myName`,
         so someone else's message has no delete affordance to click at all. Deliberately
         *narrower* than removing a task comment (`removeCommentAt`, still open to the whole team
         for tasks) — a later, more specific request than the comment behavior it otherwise
         mirrors structurally (full-array rewrite dropping exactly one entry, same `openConfirm`
         shape).
       - **Someone else's single message, or the whole chat** — both admin-only, and both real
         boundaries in `firestore.rules`, not just hidden buttons.
       - **The whole chat** (`deleteProjectChat`, the trash icon in the thread header, hidden
         entirely unless `isAdminUser()`) uses `deleteField()` on both `chat` and `links` rather
         than writing empty arrays — this is what makes `Array.isArray(doc.chat)` go back to
         `false`, so the project actually disappears from the Chat tab's list and becomes
         eligible for "New chat" again, instead of lingering as a visible-but-empty conversation.
         If the deleted chat was the one currently open, the view falls back to the empty state
         and tears down its typing subscription, the same cleanup `stopListeners` does at sign-out.
       - **The client-side `isAdminUser()`/author-match checks are UX only — the real boundary is
         in `firestore.rules`.** `projects`' `update` rule reads `chat`'s size before and after a
         write (anyone can grow it — post; or leave it unchanged — react), and for a shrink,
         isolates exactly which entry disappeared with `resource.data.chat.removeAll
         (request.resource.data.chat)` (old minus new — safe specifically because a delete leaves
         every *other* entry byte-for-byte unchanged, so this can't misidentify the wrong one).
         `chatSingleOwnRemoval()` then requires the shrink to be by exactly one entry *and* that
         entry's `author` to match the requester's own token name/email — anything else (someone
         else's message, or more than one entry at once) falls through to `isAdmin()`. Same
         "count what actually changed" spirit as `tasks`' own `changedKeys().hasOnly([...])`
         carve-out, just measuring array contents instead of which fields changed.
         `!('chat' in resource.data)` is there so a project creating its **first** chat (a field
         appearing where it didn't exist) doesn't get misread as a shrink and blocked for
         non-admins — that path stays open to everyone, unchanged from before this rule existed.
         **`removeAll()` and list-indexing (`removed[0]`) were not exercised against a live
         Firestore emulator** (none available in the environment this was written in) — if either
         turns out to be invalid Rules syntax, the console will refuse to *publish* the file
         outright (a compile error) rather than silently misenforcing, but this is worth an actual
         test — two accounts, one deleting the other's message — the next time this file changes.
     - **Archived/completed projects keep their chat fully visible and functional, with a quiet
       "Completed" tag** (`isProjectFullyArchived`, same `activeCount === 0` definition
       `renderProjects`' own Ongoing/Completed split already uses) — asked directly ("how about
       projects that are archived?"). Nothing about a project wrapping up should make its chat
       disappear or go read-only: people reference a finished project's thread for exactly the
       reason the Archived *task* view stays browsable instead of being a graveyard ("what did
       the client say back in Q1"). The Chat tab now calls `ensureArchivedTasksListener()` on
       entry (mirroring the Projects tab) so `archivedTasks` is actually loaded for this check,
       not just whichever tasks happen to already be in memory from an earlier view.
     - **Chat's search box moved off the centered treatment it shared with Activity** — reported
       directly ("move search bar to the right"). `syncToolbarLayout()`'s centering used to be
       the same boolean as the filter-hiding one (`TOOLBAR_HIDDEN_FILTER_VIEWS`, both Activity and
       Chat), which made sense back when both views were "just a lone search box, nothing else in
       the row." Chat no longer fits that: it has its own controls (New chat, My chats) directly
       below the toolbar, so a centered search box above them read as floating/misplaced in a way
       it doesn't on Activity, which still has nothing else there. The two concerns are now
       split — `TOOLBAR_HIDDEN_FILTER_VIEWS` still governs which views hide the four filter
       dropdowns (Activity and Chat, unchanged), but centering is now `currentView === 'activity'`
       specifically, and everything else (including Chat) right-aligns.
     - **A dot+count on the sidebar's own "Chat" link** (`renderChatNavBadge`, `#chat-nav-badge`)
       — asked directly, in two parts ("does chat notifications appear on the sidebar?" → no →
       "build the chat dot with number on side bar"). No new data model: the same `notifications`
       collection and `read` flag the bell already tracks, narrowed to the subset carrying
       `chatProject` (an @mention in a project chat — see `notifyOnProjectChat` — the only thing
       that currently notifies about chat activity at all, same as a plain task comment with no
       @mention notifies nobody). Called alongside `renderNotificationBell()` from the same
       `notifications` `onSnapshot` handler, since it's reading the exact same `myNotifications`
       array, just filtered further — there's no separate read-state to invent or keep in sync.
       Positioned `absolute` on the nav button (`relative` added to the button itself) rather
       than inline after the label, specifically so it still renders — overlaid on the icon's
       top-right corner — when the sidebar is collapsed to its icon-only rail, not just in the
       expanded label view.
       - **A mention notification only ever cleared by explicitly clicking it in the bell panel
         or hitting "Mark all read" — opening the same chat by any other route left it sitting
         unread indefinitely.** Reported directly ("when the message is replied to or read, the
         notifications should not remain"). `markChatNotificationsRead(name)` marks every unread
         notification carrying that `chatProject` as read, called from `selectChatProject` (the
         moment the chat is opened, however it was opened — the Chat tab's own project list, a
         deep link, not just the bell) and again from the end of `renderChatDetail` (so a *new*
         mention landing while the chat is already open clears itself too). Replying requires the
         chat to already be open, so covering "opened" covers "replied to" as well without a
         separate check tied to sending a message — there was never a need to special-case
         `sendProjectChatMessage` on top of this.
     - **Lives on the same `projects/{id}` doc as the deadline**, not a new collection —
       `chat` (array of `{id, text, author, date, reactions}`, same shape/append pattern as task
       comments: `arrayUnion` to add, a full-array rewrite to edit an existing entry's fields)
       and `links` (array of `{id, label, url}`). `createProjectChat` reuses
       `projectDeadlineDoc(name)`'s existing find-or-create logic rather than adding a second
       lookup — the function predates chat but was never deadline-specific in what it does, just
       in what it was originally written for.
     - **Reuses `enrichCommentText`/`parseMentions` wholesale** for @mentions and auto-linking
       pasted URLs — a chat message is rendered exactly like a task comment's text, so "links and
       images" just means "paste the Drive/image URL and it becomes clickable," the same as
       comments already do. No separate URL-linkifying code.
     - **Every project assignee gets notified on every chat message, not just @mentions** —
       requested directly ("user don't have to be tagged to receive a notification"), compared
       against WhatsApp's own group behavior before building: WhatsApp notifies every group
       *member* on every message regardless of @mention (a mention there only matters for
       bypassing a *muted* group, a feature this app doesn't have) — membership is explicit, not
       inferred. This app has no explicit "who's in this chat" list at all, so `projectAssignees
       (projectName)` (every distinct `assignee` across that project's active *and* archived
       tasks) is the closest available stand-in for "who's actually on this," chosen directly
       over two alternatives: "everyone who's posted in this chat before" (rejected — it can't
       notify anyone on a chat's very first message) and "the whole team" (rejected — too noisy
       with no per-chat mute to fall back on).
       - **A recipient's notification type is per-person, not per-message** — `notifyOnProjectChat`
         unions `parseMentions(text)` with `projectAssignees(projectName)` into one recipient set
         (so someone who's both @mentioned and a project assignee gets exactly one notification,
         not two), keyed by name so the sender is excluded from their own broadcast the same way
         self-mentions were already excluded. Each recipient's stored `type` is `'chat_mention'`
         if they were actually named, `'chat_post'` otherwise — `renderNotificationBell` and
         `fireDesktopNotification` both branch on this to say "mentioned you in" vs. "posted in,"
         so a plain broadcast notification never claims a mention that didn't happen.
       - **Called unconditionally now, not just when there's text** — forwarding a caption-less
         screenshot, or posting one directly, both still notify a project's assignees;
         previously `if (caption)`/`if (original.text)` skipped the call entirely for an
         image-only message, which (before this change) only meant "no mention was possible
         anyway," but now would have skipped the whole assignee broadcast too.
         `notifyOnProjectChat` takes a `hasImage` third argument so a caption-less image's
         snippet still reads as "Photo" (matching the same fallback used elsewhere) instead of
         an empty notification body.
       - The notification doc carries a `chatProject` field instead of `taskId`/`taskName`;
         `renderNotificationBell` and the notification-list click handler both branch on its
         presence, and clicking switches to the Chat tab and calls `selectChatProject
         (chatProject)` instead of opening a task — same as before this change, unaffected by it.
     - **Reacting to a message notifies its author** (`notifyOnChatReaction`) — reported directly
       ("emoji reactions should create a notification"), confirmed via `toggleProjectChatReaction`
       that this genuinely didn't happen before (a plain Firestore update to the message's
       `reactions` field, no notification write anywhere near it). Unlike `notifyOnProjectChat`,
       this is never a broadcast — only the one message's own author is notified, since a
       reaction is about that specific message, not something the whole project team needs to
       hear about. Only fires on the *add* half of the toggle (`toggleProjectChatReaction` tracks
       this with a local `added` flag) — removing a reaction stays silent, and reacting to your
       own message never notifies you (`notifyOnChatReaction` checks `message.author !== myName`
       itself, a second guard beyond the UI never offering a way to react to nothing). Its own
       `type: 'chat_reaction'` reads "reacted to your message in" in both the bell panel and the
       desktop popup title — a third wording alongside `chat_mention`/`chat_post`, not folded into
       either, since reacting is neither posting nor mentioning.
     - **Read receipts, WhatsApp-style ticks on your own messages only** — requested directly
       ("similar to WhatsApp, can I see whether my message is received or read?"), with the one
       real difference from WhatsApp raised and confirmed before building: WhatsApp's receipts
       work off an explicit, bounded group membership list, which this app's chat has never had
       (anyone on the team can open any project's chat) — so there's no fixed "everyone" to
       compare against and therefore **no third, blue "read by all" state**, just unread (single
       tick) vs. read by at least one other person (double tick, with exactly who named in the
       hover `title`). Computed entirely from data already collected for the unread-dot feature
       (`chatLastRead` on every teammate's own `people` doc, see `markChatRead`/`isChatUnread`
       above) — no new field, write, or query needed. `chatMessageHtml` computes this inline, only
       when `mine`, by checking every `teamPeople` entry (not scoped to project assignees the way
       the notification broadcast is — anyone could plausibly have opened the chat, and there's
       no noise concern for a per-message, opt-in-to-look-at indicator the way there was for a
       push notification) for a `chatLastRead` entry on this exact project whose `at` is at or
       after the message's own `date`. Live: since `teamPeople` updates trigger a full `renderAll`
       already (see the `people` `onSnapshot` handler's own comment on why), a teammate opening
       the chat elsewhere flips your ticks from single to double without any new listener.
       - **`ICONS.checkTick`/`checkTickDouble` are new, deliberately not the existing `check`
         entry** (a checkmark-in-a-circle used elsewhere for "done"/completion UI) — a bare tick
         reads as a delivery/read mark, not a completion badge, and reusing `check` would have
         made this new UI silently mean two different things depending on where it showed up.
     - **A floating "scroll to bottom" button, WhatsApp-style** — requested directly, reported
       against a screenshot of the user scrolled up reading older messages. `#project-chat-log`
       is now wrapped in a `relative` div so `#chat-scroll-to-bottom-btn` can sit `absolute` in its
       bottom-right corner; `isChatLogNearBottom(logEl)` (a `CHAT_SCROLL_BOTTOM_THRESHOLD = 100`px
       check) drives it from two places kept in sync — the log's own native `scroll` event, and
       every `renderChatDetail` re-render.
       - **Also fixed the render itself always force-scrolling to the bottom, since the button
         would have been pointless otherwise.** Before this, `renderChatDetail` unconditionally
         set `logEl.scrollTop = logEl.scrollHeight` on every render — and because the `projects`
         `onSnapshot` listener triggers a full `renderAll()` (and therefore `renderChatDetail`) on
         *any* project's change, not just the open chat's own, a teammate scrolled up reading
         history could get yanked back to the bottom by something as unrelated as someone else's
         project deadline changing. Now a `wasNearBottom` flag is captured (from
         `isChatLogNearBottom`, before the innerHTML swap changes `scrollHeight`) and the log only
         auto-scrolls when it's true; otherwise the scroll position is left alone. This relies on
         a real DOM property, not a guess: setting `.innerHTML` does not itself reset an element's
         own `scrollTop`, and since new messages render at the end, every row already above the
         fold keeps the same pixel height across the re-render — so leaving `scrollTop` untouched
         reliably keeps whatever the user was reading in view. Opening a chat for the first time
         (`isFirstRenderForThisChat`) still always counts as "at the bottom" — there's no prior
         scroll position worth preserving against.
       - **A small unread-while-scrolled-up badge rides along on the same button**
         (`chatUnseenWhileScrolledUp`, keyed by project name) — incremented per render by counting
         messages that are both genuinely new (`isNewMessage`, the same flag the message-entrance
         animation already uses) and not authored by the viewer, but only while `wasNearBottom` is
         false; reset to 0 the instant the log is back near its bottom, whether from clicking the
         button (a `smooth` `scrollTo`, the one deliberate exception to this app's usual instant
         `scrollTop =` jumps, since this one is a direct user action worth animating) or from
         scrolling down manually.
     - **An emoji picker was asked for directly, "similar to what we've built on Content Hub"** —
       ported from the sibling MS LinkedIn Hub's `createEmojiPicker`/`EMOJI_CATEGORIES`
       (`content-hub-firebase.html`), which that app's own `DESIGN.md` documents as a *deliberate
       exception* to "never emoji" — real emoji there are the feature's actual content, not UI
       chrome, same reasoning that applies here. `EMOJI_CATEGORIES`'s eight category lists are
       copied verbatim for consistency across Mediashock's tools. The factory itself is
       `createEmojiPickerPanel(tabsEl, gridEl, onPick)`, adapted rather than copied byte-for-byte:
       Content Hub's version is hardwired to one textarea (`insertAtCursor`/`onInsert`), but this
       app reuses the exact same category-tab-plus-grid UI for two different purposes (see
       below), so it takes a plain `onPick(emoji)` callback instead and leaves what "picking" an
       emoji actually does to the caller. `insertAtCursor` itself is copied unchanged.
       - **The compose box** (`#project-chat-emoji-toggle`/`#project-chat-emoji-picker`) is the
         direct port of Content Hub's usage — an inline smiley button overlaid bottom-right of
         the textarea, `onPick` inserting the emoji at the cursor via `insertAtCursor`.
       - **Reactions were asked for separately ("I want more reactions"), on the same message
         that asked for the emoji picker** — read as one request, not two: reactions became real
         emoji rather than the small fixed SVG icon set (Like/Love/Noted) this shipped with
         first. First version added a fixed 6-icon "quick reaction" row (`PROJECT_CHAT_QUICK_
         REACTIONS`) shown on *every* message regardless of whether it had any reactions, plus a
         dashed "+" opening the full picker for anything else — reported back directly as
         cluttered/distracting, so the always-visible row was removed. `chatMessageHtml` now
         renders only reactions someone has actually used, plus the same "+" — a fresh message
         with no reactions shows just the quiet "+", not six icons nobody's touched yet. The "+"
         opens `#chat-reaction-picker`, a *second* instance of the same `createEmojiPickerPanel`
         (one shared panel, not one per message) — the emoji set stays effectively unlimited
         either way, only the always-visible shortcut row was cut. `activeReactionMessageId`
         tracks which message the shared panel is currently open for.
       - **The reaction picker positions itself with `position: fixed`, computed from the
         trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()`** (`openChatReactionPicker`), the same technique
         `positionTooltip` already uses elsewhere in this file — not a CSS-relative dropdown
         anchored to the message row, which `#project-chat-log`'s own `overflow-y-auto` would
         clip the moment the panel needed to extend past the scroll container's edge. The
         compose-box picker doesn't need this: it lives in the non-scrolling footer, so a plain
         `absolute` position anchored to the textarea wrapper is safe there.
       - Toggling a reaction is a full-array rewrite of `chat` (same reason `removeCommentAt`
         rewrites the whole array) — `arrayUnion` can only append a new element, never mutate a
         field on one already in the array. Emoji characters are safe as object keys here
         specifically *because* it's a full-object rewrite, not a dotted-path `updateDoc` call —
         see the typing-presence note below for the case where that distinction does matter.
     - **WhatsApp-style bubbles, reply, and forward — all asked for directly in one message**
       ("can the chat look like whatsapp where my messages are ... on the right while the others
       are on the left? Also replying and forwarding of messages should be possible").
       `chatMessageHtml` was rebuilt around this rather than patched: own messages right-align
       with no name/avatar (you already know it's you, same reasoning WhatsApp itself skips it);
       everyone else's left-align with avatar+name above the bubble, since a *group* chat still
       needs "who said this" answered at a glance, unlike WhatsApp's 1:1 case. Bubbles are soft
       tints (`bg-brand-100`/`bg-zinc-100`), not a solid WhatsApp-green fill — `enrichCommentText`'s
       existing mention/link styling (`brand-600` text) needs a light background to stay
       readable, and white text on a solid `brand-500` bubble would have made both nearly
       invisible; changing bubble color was cheaper and safer than touching that shared function.
       Reply/forward/delete/react first shipped as an `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` icon
       row, then moved to a right-click context menu on a direct follow-up with a WhatsApp Web
       screenshot attached ("can we have the same way whatsapp does it? Right click to show
       options") — see the dedicated section below; `chatMessageHtml` today renders only the
       bubble, timestamp, and any reactions someone's actually added, nothing interactive beyond
       that at rest or on hover.
       - **Reply is a quoted preview, not a nested thread** — deliberately not a rerun of task
         comments' real `replyTo` tree (`renderCommentsLog`, which actually indents children under
         parents). Chat stays flat and chronological; a reply is just a message that carries a
         small quote of an earlier one, exactly WhatsApp's own quoted-reply, not a thread view.
         `startChatReply(messageId)` looks the original up in the *currently loaded* `pdoc.chat`
         (no separate fetch) and populates `#chat-reply-preview` above the compose box;
         `chatReplyTarget` holds `{id, author, text}` until send or cancel.
         `sendProjectChatMessage` attaches `replyTo: chatReplyTarget.id` to the new message and
         calls `cancelChatReply()` in the same `.then()` that already clears the input and the
         mention menu. `chatMessageHtml` takes the *whole* `chat` array (not just the one message)
         specifically so a reply's quote can resolve `m.replyTo` against it; if the original was
         since deleted, the quote is silently omitted — same "don't guess, don't break" fallback
         `renderCommentsLog` uses for a task comment's dangling `replyTo`.
       - **Forward copies a message into a *different* project's chat** — a materially different
         feature from task comments (which have no forward at all) because Flowboard's chats are
         one-per-project, so "forward" here specifically means *across* chats, not within one.
         `openChatForwardMenu` reuses the exact `position: fixed`/`getBoundingClientRect()`
         pattern as the reaction picker and "New chat" menu (`#chat-forward-menu`, a single shared
         panel), listing every *other* project that already has a chat — not `allProjectNames()`
         unfiltered, since forwarding into a chat that doesn't exist yet isn't offered here (start
         one via "New chat" first). `forwardChatMessage` writes a **new** message
         (`{id: uid(), text, author: <the forwarder>, forwarded: true, forwardedFrom:
         <source project>}`) via `arrayUnion` on the target doc — deliberately not attributed to
         the original author, matching WhatsApp's own convention that a forwarded message is a
         new message *you* sent, just tagged where it came from. Reactions and `replyTo` are not
         carried over; a forwarded message starts fresh with zero reactions in its new chat.
         `notifyOnProjectChat` still runs against the target project, so an @mention inside a
         forwarded message notifies there exactly like a freshly typed one would.
     - **`#chat-reply-preview` showed up permanently, empty, regardless of its `hidden`
       attribute** — reported directly ("the reply preview bar should not be there unless
       replying"), twice; the first fix attempt (bumping the whole feature) didn't address the
       actual cause. Root cause: its static class list included `flex` *alongside* the native
       `hidden` attribute. `[hidden]` (a UA-stylesheet rule) and `.flex` (an author-stylesheet
       rule) are equal specificity, and the author stylesheet always wins a tie — so `.flex`'s
       `display: flex` overrode `[hidden]`'s `display: none` regardless of whether the attribute
       was actually set at runtime. This is the identical bug class `task-project-link-row`
       already works around elsewhere in this file (see its own comment) — the fix here is the
       same: `flex` was removed from the static class list, and `startChatReply`/`cancelChatReply`
       now toggle it explicitly alongside `.hidden`, instead of leaving a competing display class
       sitting in the markup permanently. Worth checking any *other* `hidden`+`flex` (or
       `hidden`+`grid`/`block`) pairing in this file for the same latent bug — the other three
       Chat floating panels (`chat-reaction-picker`, `chat-new-menu`, `chat-forward-menu`) happen
       to be safe only because none of them pairs `hidden` with a competing display-setting class
       (`fixed` alone doesn't touch `display`).
     - **Message actions moved to a right-click context menu, WhatsApp Web's own pattern** — asked
       for directly with a screenshot of WhatsApp's real menu attached ("can we have the same way
       whatsapp does it? Right click to show options"), after the hover-icon row and the
       always-present reaction "+" were *both* separately reported as visual clutter first.
       `chatMessageHtml` now renders nothing interactive beyond existing reaction pills at rest —
       `data-message-row="<id>"` on the outer wrapper is the only hook a `contextmenu` listener on
       `#project-chat-log` needs (`e.preventDefault()`, then `openChatMessageMenu(id, e.clientX,
       e.clientY)`). One shared `#chat-message-menu` panel (`position: fixed`, positioned at the
       click coordinates the same way the other floating panels position off a trigger's rect) —
       a quick-reaction row (`CHAT_CONTEXT_REACTIONS`, WhatsApp's own six: 👍❤️😂😮😢🙏) plus a
       "+" into the full picker, then Reply / Forward / Copy / Delete. Right-click is desktop-only
       by design, same as WhatsApp's own — there's no long-press equivalent wired for touch, since
       that wasn't what was shown or asked for.
       - **Copy is new** (`#chat-message-menu-copy`, `navigator.clipboard.writeText`) — the one
         action that didn't exist in any form before this menu; every other action already existed
         as its own inline control and just moved.
       - **Delete only ever shows for your own message** — same `msg.author !== myName` check the
         old inline button used, still backed by the same `firestore.rules` boundary
         (`chatSingleOwnRemoval`) regardless of where the button that triggers it lives.
       - **Forward and the reaction "+" both read their trigger button's position *before* closing
         the message menu**, not after — `openChatForwardMenu`/`openChatReactionPicker` compute
         their own position from `getBoundingClientRect()` on the button that opened them, which
         returns a meaningless all-zero rect once that button's ancestor menu is `hidden`.
     - **Individual chat messages don't appear in the Activity feed; creating/deleting a whole
       chat thread does.** First reported for messages only ("chat messages should not appear in
       Activity") — `logActivity` calls for posting, removing, and forwarding a message
       (`project_chat`) were removed outright, since they'd have flooded a task-focused audit log
       with routine chat traffic and surfaced message *snippets* well beyond the chat itself.
       - **Briefly extended to creating/deleting the thread too, then reverted the same day.**
         A screenshot of a feed dominated by "Posted/Created/Deleted... group chat" rows (from a
         team actively testing the chat feature) first read as "all of this is noise" — `logActivity`
         was dropped from `createProjectChat`/`deleteProjectChat` and `renderActivityFeed` was
         changed to filter out all three types. Corrected directly right after ("create and delete
         project chat should still log under activity"): creating/deleting a thread is a
         project-level event, closer in kind to a deadline change than to the message traffic
         inside it, and stays rare enough not to be noise on its own — it was only *adjacent* noise
         while sitting in the same feed as dozens of per-message rows. Both `logActivity` calls
         are back in `createProjectChat`/`deleteProjectChat`; only `project_chat` stays in
         `HIDDEN_ACTIVITY_TYPES` now.
       - **The stale `project_chat`-type entries already written before the messages fix can't be
         deleted through the app.** `activity` is append-only by design (`allow update, delete: if
         false` in `firestore.rules`, same convention as every audit log in this codebase — see
         the top-level `CLAUDE.md`'s "two rules conventions" section) specifically so nobody can
         erase the record of what they did. `renderActivityFeed` filters `activityLog` against
         `HIDDEN_ACTIVITY_TYPES` before rendering instead, hiding those rows from the feed without
         touching the underlying (immutable) documents — the only way to actually remove them from
         Firestore is deleting them directly in the Firebase console, not through anything this
         codebase exposes.
     - **Typing indicators and reactions were asked for directly, then the free-tier constraint
       was clarified before building either.** Both are plain Firestore field writes with no
       Cloud Storage dependency, so both fit inside Spark's free quota (50k reads/20k writes per
       day) — an 11-person team posting and reacting in one project chat comes nowhere close.
       The one genuine free-tier wall in this app is images/file *uploads*: Cloud Storage for
       Firebase stopped supporting the Spark plan for new buckets in a 2024 policy change, which
       is why links stay paste-only (see above) rather than a real upload/attach flow.
       - **Typing presence** (`projectTyping/{projectId}`, same doc id as the project doc) is
         `{entries: [{name, at}]}`, a plain array rather than a map keyed by display name — a
         name containing "." would otherwise be read as a nested field path by `setDoc`/
         `updateDoc`'s dotted-key handling (e.g. "J. Tan"), silently writing to the wrong place.
         The chat view keeps its own local cache of the latest snapshot
         (`latestChatTypingEntries`) rather than calling `getDoc` fresh on every heartbeat — a
         project has to already be selected (and therefore already subscribed) for anyone to
         type into its chat, so the cache is never actually stale when a heartbeat needs it.
         Entries age out after `PROJECT_CHAT_TYPING_TTL_MS` (8s); a person's own entry also
         clears immediately on blur/send/switching to a different project rather than waiting
         out the TTL, and a plain `setInterval` re-render (`chatTypingTickTimer`, every 2s) is
         what actually hides a stale entry for everyone else once nobody's written a newer
         heartbeat over it — nothing server-side expires it.
       - **Firestore rules needed a new, deliberately wide-open collection block**
         (`projectTyping` in `firestore.rules`) — enumerated explicitly rather than folded into
         an existing rule, per this app's "never `match /{document=**}`" convention. Whole-team
         read/write, same as `projects` itself: there's no per-message ownership to scope here,
         just a small rolling presence list.
     - **Switching the selected project tears down and re-subscribes typing presence
       (`selectChatProject`); switching *tabs* away from Chat does not.** The typing
       subscription and its 2s render timer just keep running cheaply in the background — same
       as every other listener in this app (tasks/people/projects/activity all stay subscribed
       regardless of which view is on screen) — until the selection actually changes or the
       session signs out (`stopListeners` tears both down explicitly, since nothing else would).
     - **The Chat tab re-renders live from the same `projects` listener that already drives the
       deadline UI** — `renderCurrentSecondaryView()` (called from `renderAll()`, which both
       `unsubProjects` and `unsubPeople`'s `onSnapshot` handlers already call on every change)
       calls `renderChatView()` whenever Chat is the current tab, the same way the `tasks`
       listener already re-renders an open task modal. A teammate's new message, reaction,
       pinned link, or presence heartbeat shows up without needing its own listener — resist
       adding an explicit `renderChatView()` call inside either handler; it's already covered by
       the `renderAll()` they call and would just render twice.
     - **The chat's "photo"** (`chatAvatarHtml`, in the tab's project list and the selected
       thread's header) — requested directly ("upload an image for the group chat profile"), but
       a real upload needs Firebase Storage, which no longer supports the free Spark plan for new
       buckets (same wall as every image feature in every Mediashock tool). Built as the
       zero-infrastructure option instead: a solid colored circle with the project's initials,
       the same "colored initials" idea `avatarHtml` already uses for a person with no photo, on
       `PROJECT_AVATAR_PALETTE` — the same 8 hues and hash formula as the existing
       `PROJECT_BADGE_PALETTE`/`projectColor` (the Gantt's project-color badges), so a project's
       chat avatar always lands on the same hue as its badge elsewhere rather than being a third,
       independent color source for the same identity.
       - **The letters shown are `projectInitials(name)`, not the plain `initials()` people use
         — reported directly against a screenshot where nearly every avatar read "2-something".**
         This team's project-naming convention stamps every project with a same-shaped leading
         date ("271231[LittlePaddington]…", "260820[Lark]…"), so plain first-letter-of-first-word
         degenerated to the same digit for almost every project on the board — exactly the
         opposite of "easier identification." `projectInitials` instead pulls from the `[Client]`
         bracket when one exists (confirmed directly: the bracket, not whatever follows it, is
         the part people actually mean when they refer to a project — "the Lark one"), inserting
         a space at camelCase boundaries first since these brackets run words together with no
         spaces of their own ("LittlePaddington" → "Little"/"Paddington" → "LP"). No bracket at
         all falls back to the same leading-date-strip against the whole name, then plain
         `initials()` if that leaves nothing to work with. **Two projects sharing a client
         bracket will share initials** ("[Mediashock]" appears on three of this board's real
         projects) — accepted as correct, not a bug to route around, since the color underneath
         still differs (it's hashed on the *full* name) and the client grouping itself is real
         information, not a collision to hide.
     - **Online presence** (`isPersonOnline`, the green dot on message avatars, the "Online now"
       strip above the two panes) — also requested directly, decided as the cheap option over a
       Firebase Realtime Database `onDisconnect()` presence system (put to the user rather than
       assumed, same as the Google-photo-vs-upload choice on the `people` collection). Reuses
       `people.lastSeen`, which `registerPresence` already wrote once per sign-in, rather than a
       new field or collection: `startPresenceHeartbeat` now refreshes it every
       `PRESENCE_HEARTBEAT_MS` (60s) for as long as the session stays open, plus immediately on
       `visibilitychange` going visible (so reopening a laptop reads as "back online" right away,
       not up to a minute later), and `stopListeners` stops the interval at sign-out.
       `isPersonOnline(name)` treats "seen within `ONLINE_THRESHOLD_MS`" (2 minutes) as online.
       - **This is approximate by design, not a bug**: a silent disconnect (closed lid, lost
         wifi, killed tab) has no "I'm offline now" write to react to, so nobody finds out until
         the heartbeat simply stops arriving. A real Realtime Database presence system would
         catch this instantly via `onDisconnect()`, at the cost of adding a second Firebase
         product (its own security rules, its own thing to keep in sync) to a stack that
         currently only needs Firestore + Auth. Revisit if 2-minute staleness ever actually
         bothers anyone; don't add it pre-emptively.
       - **`renderChatOnlineStrip`'s own `setInterval` (30s) is what actually ages a teammate
         back out to offline** for everyone else, since — per the point above — nothing writes a
         new `people` doc when someone goes quiet, so no `onSnapshot` ever fires to trigger a
         re-render on its own. 30s is deliberately coarser than the typing indicator's 2s tick;
         online/offline doesn't need that grade of immediacy.
       - **`presenceAvatarHtml` wraps `avatarHtml` rather than adding a parameter to it** — scoped
         to Chat's message authors specifically (where online status was asked for), so every
         other call site (task comments, time entries, People cards, Focus of the Day, …) is
         completely untouched.
     - **In-chat search** (`#chat-search-toggle`/`#chat-search-bar`) — requested directly
       ("search within the chat itself should also be possible just like WhatsApp"), distinct
       from `filters.search` on the project list, which only narrows which *chats* are listed.
       Matches message text only (not author names or pinned links). `runChatSearch` reads
       straight from `projectDeadlineDoc(currentChatProjectName).chat`, not from the rendered
       DOM, so match count/order is correct even for messages currently scrolled out of view;
       highlighting is applied separately by walking each matched row's `.chat-message-text`
       text nodes with a `TreeWalker` and wrapping hits in `<mark>` (`highlightTextNode`), rather
       than string-replacing that paragraph's `innerHTML` — the bubble can already contain `<a>`
       tags from `enrichCommentText`'s mention/link handling, and a naive replace risks matching
       inside a tag and corrupting the markup. `clearChatSearchHighlights` reverses it by
       swapping each `<mark>` back for a plain text node and calling `.normalize()`.
       - **`#chat-search-bar` uses the same `hidden`-attribute-plus-JS-toggled-`flex`-class
         idiom as `#chat-reply-preview`** — `flex` is deliberately absent from its static class
         list; putting it there would silently win the display property over `hidden` at rest
         (same CSS-specificity bug documented above), leaving the bar permanently visible.
       - **Re-runs itself on every `renderChatDetail`** (a live update while search is open,
         e.g. a new message arriving mid-search) rather than just jumping to the bottom, since a
         fresh `innerHTML` wipes any `<mark>` wrapping from the previous pass. Re-running resets
         which match is "current" to the first one again — an accepted simplification, not
         tracked as a bug, since a live update mid-search is a rare edge case.
       - Enter/Shift+Enter step to the next/previous match; Escape closes the bar. Switching
         chats (`selectChatProject`) always calls `closeChatSearch()`, same as it already does
         for an in-progress reply or forward, so a search someone was mid-typing doesn't
         silently carry over into a different project's thread.
     - **The chat list's subtitle now shows the latest message, not a message count** —
       reported directly against a screenshot of a real WhatsApp chat list ("the text below the
       chat title should reflect the latest message... show the last update of day or time").
       `renderChatProjectList` reads `chat[chat.length - 1]` and renders `"<author>: <text>"`
       (`"You: …"` for your own last message), with a `chatListTimestamp` on the same row as the
       project name — a bare time for anything sent today, `"Yesterday"` for exactly one day
       back, else a short date, mirroring `activityDateHeader`'s own "Today"/"Yesterday" idiom
       without the full weekday+year the Activity feed's version uses (this has to fit on one
       line next to the project name).
     - **The chat list's default width went 256 → 128 → 400.** 256 (`w-64`) first read as too
       wide against a screenshot of the column at its old default; halving it to 128, a literal
       reading of "make it 50% the default," turned out cramped in practice — confirmed visually
       while testing that pass, `#chat-project-list-pane`'s own header row ("CHATS" + "New chat")
       and every row's name/preview/timestamp all clipped hard. 400 is the number that actually
       stuck, on request after being offered as the recommendation: it matches WhatsApp Web's own
       real list-pane proportions (roughly 380-420px against a typical window), which this whole
       chat feature has been modeled on throughout, and gives each row's now-denser content
       (avatar, name, completed tag, unread dot, star, timestamp, preview line) real room.
       `CHAT_LIST_WIDTH_MIN` is now **320** (it was 200): the three filter pills need ~316px side by
       side and were crushed below that, reported directly. Enforced three ways: the drag clamp,
       `applyChatListWidth` (never paints narrower, even when a small window's 50% cap is less),
       and `lg:min-w-[320px]` on the pane. A width saved under the old floor is raised, not discarded.
       - **A real bug surfaced while landing on 400: the default was silently getting clamped
         down to the 200px floor on every fresh sign-in**, only correcting itself once someone
         manually dragged the column. Root cause: `chatListMaxWidth()` (the 50%-of-row cap) falls
         back to `CHAT_LIST_WIDTH_MIN` when `#chat-panes-row` measures 0-wide, which it reliably
         does at module load and on every `resize` — both of which can fire while the Chat tab
         isn't the active view. `applyChatListWidth()` used to assign that fallback straight back
         into `chatListWidth` itself (`chatListWidth = Math.min(chatListWidth, chatListMaxWidth())`),
         permanently downgrading the real preference to 200 the first time it ran, with nothing
         ever able to raise it back up afterward. Fixed two ways together: `applyChatListWidth`
         now clamps into a local `display` variable for `pane.style.width` rather than overwriting
         `chatListWidth`, and `loadChatListWidth` dropped its own upper-bound check against
         `chatListMaxWidth()` at load time (which had the same 0-wide-row problem, and could
         silently discard a perfectly valid wider *saved* width in favour of the default on
         reload). `setView('chat')` also now calls `applyChatListWidth()` once on entry, so the
         very first time someone opens the tab in a session it re-measures against the row's real
         width immediately rather than waiting for the next resize.
     - **Favourite chats and unread tracking**, both requested directly in the same message
       ("make favourite chats a feature and it should sort alongside My chats. Unread chats
       should also be included in the sorting"):
       - **Favouriting** (`isFavoriteChat`/`toggleFavoriteChat`, the per-row star toggle) and
         **read tracking** (`isChatUnread`/`markChatRead`) both persist on the signed-in person's
         own `people/{uid}` doc — `favoriteChats` and `chatLastRead` respectively — the same doc
         `registerPresence`/`heartbeatPresence` already write to, chosen directly over
         `localStorage` so both stay correct across devices/sessions. No `firestore.rules` change
         needed: `people/{uid}` was already writable only by its own uid, and both are just new
         fields on that same document.
       - **Both are plain arrays of records, not maps keyed by project name** — `favoriteChats`
         is `[name, ...]`, `chatLastRead` is `[{project, at}, ...]`. Same reasoning `projectTyping`
         already documented above: a project name containing "." would otherwise be read as a
         nested field path by `updateDoc`'s dotted-key handling, silently writing to the wrong
         place. `chatLastRead` in particular has to upsert by project name on every write
         (replace-if-present, else append), which is why it's a full read-modify-write rather
         than `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` — those only add/remove a literal whole entry, not
         "replace the entry for project X regardless of its old `at`."
       - **`markChatRead` runs both when a chat is opened and on every subsequent re-render while
         it's still open** (called from the end of `renderChatDetail`, not `selectChatProject`,
         since the former already covers both cases) — otherwise a message arriving while someone
         is actively looking at that chat would leave it marked unread again the next time they
         glanced at the list. It skips the write once the stored `at` already covers the latest
         message, so re-rendering an already-caught-up chat doesn't write to Firestore on every
         unrelated snapshot.
       - **Sort order**: favourites first, then unread, then everything else, each tier
         newest-message-first — confirmed directly over a simpler "favourites only, unread is
         just a badge" alternative. Replaces the previous plain-alphabetical order entirely;
         `allProjectNames()` still supplies the starting list, `renderChatProjectList`'s own
         `.sort()` reorders it into these three tiers afterward.
       - **My chats / Favourites / Unread are mutually exclusive, one shared `chatListFilterMode`
         (`null | 'mine' | 'favorites' | 'unread'`) rather than three independent booleans** —
         built independently-combinable first, then corrected directly right after ("only one
         chat sort can be allowed at a given time"). `setChatListFilterMode(mode)` toggles: picking
         a new mode always clears whichever was active, clicking the currently-active one clears
         back to `null` (show everything) — same on/off feel each pill had standalone, just
         exclusive now. All three buttons share one `syncChatFilterToggleUI` that styles whichever
         one matches the current mode and un-styles the other two, rather than three near-identical
         per-button sync functions. Still session-local, like "My chats" always was — only the
         favourite *status* and read-state themselves persist (on the person doc above); which
         filter is currently narrowing the list resets on reload.
       - **The row had to stop being a real `<button>`** (`role="button" tabindex="0"` `<div>`
         now) to host the star toggle as a real nested `<button>` — a `<button>` inside another
         `<button>` is invalid HTML that browsers hoist/break unpredictably. The delegated click
         listener on `#chat-project-list` checks for `.chat-favorite-toggle` first and returns
         before reaching the row-select logic; a parallel `keydown` listener supplies the
         Enter/Space activation a real `<button>` would give for free. `.chat-project-row:active`
         was added alongside the global `button:not(:disabled):active` press-feedback rule, since
         that rule only ever matches actual `<button>` elements and this row no longer is one.
     - **The chat header's subtitle shows the project's Drive folder, not a static caption** —
       reported directly against a screenshot ("it would be more useful to have the project
       folder link there") in place of "Group chat for this project — separate from task
       comments." There's no dedicated project-level Drive link field; `driveLink` lives per
       *task* (see the task modal's Project field). `projectDriveLink(name)` finds the first task
       under that project with a non-empty `driveLink` and uses it — in practice every task in a
       project points at the same folder, so the first match stands in for "this project's
       folder." Falls back to a plain "No project folder linked yet" line when no task under that
       project has one. Re-derived on every `renderChatDetail` (not just when the chat is first
       opened), so editing a task's Drive link while this chat happens to be open updates the
       header live, the same way a new message does.
       - **Shows the link's actual location, not the word "Project folder"** — reported directly
         right after ("show the path/location of the folder instead of 'project folder' for the
         link"). Rebuilt around the exact folder-icon-plus-truncated-URL treatment the task
         modal's own `#task-drive-open` already uses (`syncDriveLinkButtons`): the `https://`
         scheme is stripped for display, the anchor truncates with an ellipsis inside a
         `min-w-0 flex-1` flex row (icon `shrink-0` beside it, same structure as
         `#task-project-link-row`), and the full URL still lives in `title` for a hover tooltip.
         `#project-chat-subtitle` itself dropped its own `truncate` class once the inner anchor
         took over truncation — redundant `white-space: nowrap` on the outer `<p>` had nothing
         left to do once the flex child was sized to fill it.
     - **"Pinned links"'s label/url/submit row is now hidden until "+ Add" is clicked** —
       reported directly ("this should only appear when clicking 'add'. Move Add button to the
       same row as Pinned links but right aligned"). `#project-chat-link-toggle` sits on the
       "Pinned links" row itself, right-aligned via `justify-between`; clicking it a second time
       while open closes it back up, same as the "New chat" dropdown's own trigger button. Same
       `hidden`-attribute-plus-JS-toggled-`flex`-class idiom as `#chat-reply-preview`/
       `#chat-search-bar` for the same reason — `flex` is deliberately absent from
       `#project-chat-link-form`'s static class list. `closeProjectChatLinkForm()` is also called
       from `selectChatProject`, alongside the existing reply/forward/search resets, so an open
       "add a link" form doesn't silently carry over into a different project's chat. A pushpin
       icon (`ICONS.pin`) sits next to the "Pinned links" label itself, requested directly right
       after — the section header had no visual tie to what a literal pin means beyond its text.
     - **SWITCHED OFF (2026-10-07): `CHAT_IMAGES_ENABLED = false`.** Everything below assumed the
       project had been upgraded to Blaze. It hadn't: the console's Storage page still offers
       "Upgrade project", so there is no bucket and every upload (desktop paste, phone photo
       button) failed with an error toast. Asked whether to upgrade or hide it: "hide it for now".
       Off means no desktop screenshot paste, no photo button in phone chat, and the Chat page tour
       doesn't mention screenshots. **To turn it on:** upgrade to Blaze, create the Storage bucket
       (a US region qualifies for Google's free allowance; Singapore is faster but bills from the
       first byte, still pennies at this volume), publish `storage.rules`, set a budget alert, then
       set the flag to true and add a New Updates entry.
     - **Chat image sharing** — requested directly ("can sharing of screenshots be allowed on
       chat"), the first real deviation from "$0/month, needs no server" this app has taken
       (see the top-level `Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md`'s own note on this). Two options were
       weighed against it directly: a client-side upload to a free third-party image host
       (`localStorage` API key, same pattern MS Creatives already uses for its AI features) was
       rejected because chat screenshots can be client-confidential and that would put them on
       a service Mediashock doesn't control; rendering an already-hosted image link inline with
       no new infrastructure was rejected because it doesn't solve "paste a screenshot from your
       clipboard," the actual ask. **Firebase Storage on the Blaze plan** won, on the reasoning
       that an 11-person team's chat screenshots comfortably fit inside Blaze's free-tier
       allotment (5GB storage, 1GB/day download) in practice, even though Blaze removes the hard
       $0 guarantee Spark has.
       - **Needs two manual steps outside this codebase before any of it works, neither of which
         ships by pushing to `main`**: (1) upgrade the `pscr-project-manager` Firebase project
         from Spark to Blaze (requires attaching a billing account — the actual reason Spark
         stopped allowing new Storage buckets in 2024 in the first place) and enable Cloud
         Storage for it; (2) deploy `storage.rules` (`firebase deploy --only storage`, or paste
         into the Firebase console's Storage Rules tab) — same "rules aren't part of the site
         deploy" gotcha `firestore.rules` already has, now with a second rules file to remember.
         Until both are done, every upload attempt fails caught-and-toasted ("Could not send
         image: ..."), not silently and not by crashing the app.
       - **Paste is the only entry point, deliberately** — a screenshot tool (Snipping Tool,
         Cmd+Shift+4, …) puts the image directly on the clipboard, and pasting into
         `#project-chat-input` is the one place in this app a plain image paste is expected to do
         something other than insert text (there's no text form of an image to paste anyway).
         `uploadAndSendChatImage(file)` uploads to `chat-images/{projectId}/{uid()}.{ext}` in
         Storage, gets a download URL, and sends a chat message shaped like every other one but
         with `imageUrl` set and `text` optionally carrying whatever was already typed as a
         caption. No drag-and-drop or file-picker button was added — paste covers the actual
         request, and either could be layered on later reusing the same upload function if asked.
       - **A plain `<img src="...">` pointed at the Storage download URL doesn't work, and this
         is not a smaller-scope corner cut — it's why `storage.rules` requiring auth is even
         possible in a browser at all.** A browser's own `<img>` tag makes an anonymous GET with
         no way to attach an `Authorization` header, so a rules-protected file requested that way
         gets denied outright (a broken-image icon for literally everyone, including signed-in
         teammates) rather than degrading gracefully. `chatMessageHtml` renders the thumbnail
         with no `src` at all — just `data-chat-image-src` holding the real URL — and
         `loadProtectedChatImage(imgEl, url)` fetches it manually with a Bearer ID token
         (`auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`) and points the `<img>` at a `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`
         instead. This is *why* the read rule could be `isMediashock()`-gated rather than public:
         the alternative most Firebase-Storage-backed apps default to (`allow read: if true`,
         because that's the only way a bare `<img>` tag works) would have quietly undone the
         entire reason this went through Storage instead of a public third-party host.
         - **`chat-image-loading` is a real CSS floor (`min-height`/`min-width`), not decorative
           polish** — an `<img>` with no `src` has no intrinsic size, so the grey placeholder
           background would otherwise paint into an invisible 0x0 box. Removed the moment `src`
           is actually set, so a short or very wide screenshot isn't stuck reserving more space
           than it ends up needing.
         - **`chatImageObjectUrls` tracks every blob URL created for the currently-rendered log,
           revoked in a batch at the top of every `renderChatDetail`** — `renderChatDetail`
           replaces the whole log's `innerHTML` on every live update (a new message, a reaction,
           …), and nothing else in this app ever calls `URL.revokeObjectURL` on these, so a long
           session would otherwise leak one blob per image per render, forever.
       - **A click opens a same-page lightbox (`#chat-image-lightbox`), not a new tab** — a
         `blob:` URL is only guaranteed valid in the document that created it, and browsers vary
         on honoring it in a freshly opened tab, which a same-page overlay sidesteps entirely.
         Click anywhere on the overlay (including the enlarged image itself, since the click
         handler is on the overlay and clicks bubble to it) or press Escape to close — same
         `hidden`-attribute-without-a-competing-`flex`-class idiom as `#chat-reply-preview`/
         `#chat-search-bar` elsewhere in this file, toggled by JS instead of left in the static
         class list.
       - **An image-only message (no caption) shows "Photo," not a blank line, everywhere a
         message would otherwise preview as text** — the quoted-reply preview (both the compose
         box's `#chat-reply-preview-text` and a sent message's own quoted block in
         `chatMessageHtml`) and the chat list's own latest-message subtitle. Same fallback logic
         in three places rather than a shared helper, since each site builds its string
         differently (plain `textContent` vs. HTML with an icon vs. a `<span>` folded into a
         larger sentence) — worth consolidating if a fourth site ever needs the same fallback.
       - **A forwarded image message reuses the same Storage URL rather than re-uploading** —
         `forwardChatMessage` copies `imageUrl` onto the new message the same way it already
         copies `text`; it's the same file, still covered by the same `storage.rules` read check
         for whoever's now looking at it in the target project's chat.
       - **Deleting a message or a whole chat now deletes its image files** (`deleteChatImageFiles`,
         called after `removeChatMessage`/`deleteProjectChat` succeed). It was a known gap until
         phone photo sharing made volume more likely. **A file still used by any other message is
         kept**: a forwarded image reuses the original's URL, so deleting the original must not
         break the copy in another chat. The messages being removed are excluded by id rather than
         waiting for the projects snapshot, so it doesn't race the snapshot. Needs `allow delete` in
         `storage.rules` deployed (create and delete are separate rules because `request.resource`
         is null on a delete, so the old size/type `write` rule denied every delete); until that
         deploy, the delete fails quietly and the file just stays. Files orphaned before this
         shipped are not cleaned up.
       - **Images are shrunk before upload** (`shrinkChatImage`, used by `uploadChatImage`, which
         both the desktop paste and the phone's photo button go through): longest side at most
         1600px, re-encoded as JPEG at 0.82 on a white background. Measured: a 2.5 MB photo went up
         as 328 KB. Images already under ~600 KB that fit are left untouched so screenshot text
         stays crisp; anything the browser can't decode (HEIC on desktop Chrome) goes up as-is.
         Asked "will attaching photos incur costs?": the answer was effectively no at this volume
         (a few cents a month at most if the bucket sits outside Google's US free-tier regions),
         and shrinking is what keeps it there. Also recommended: a budget alert in Google Cloud
         Billing (owner's step, not code).
       - **Not verified against a live upload** — this environment has no Firebase CLI/emulator
         and, as of writing, the project hadn't yet been upgraded to Blaze, so the actual
         upload → download-URL → authenticated-fetch → blob-URL round trip has only been
         exercised in pieces: real click/keydown/paste-interception behavior against synthetic
         data (a real 1×1 PNG blob standing in for a fetched one, a fake clipboard image item
         confirming the paste listener intercepts and calls `uploadAndSendChatImage`), not the
         real Storage upload itself. Worth a real two-screenshot test — post one, forward it,
         delete it — once Blaze is live and `storage.rules` is deployed.
     - **Six features compared against Slack, then all six built** ("compare this PM tool with
       Slack. What are some features that can be applicable here?" → "build all"). The framing
       going in: Slack is a full messaging platform where channels are the primary surface;
       Flowboard's chat is one feature bolted onto a task board, so the point was never "copy
       Slack" wholesale, just borrowing the individual mechanics that fit.
       - **Unread count, not just a dot** (`chatUnreadCount`, replacing the old boolean
         `isChatUnread`) — Slack shows an actual number on an unread channel, not a plain
         indicator. Counts every message from someone else newer than `chatLastRead`, not just
         whether the *latest* message is unread — a real fix over the old boolean's edge case,
         where a message you sent after two unread ones from someone else would have hidden them
         entirely (the old check only ever looked at the last message's author). `isChatUnread`
         is now just `chatUnreadCount(name) > 0`, so every existing caller (the sort tier, the
         bold name styling) kept working unchanged. Same "9+" cap the notification bell's own
         badge already uses.
       - **Basic text formatting** — `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `` `code` ``, added to
         `applyBasicFormatting` inside the *shared* `enrichCommentText` (task comments get this
         too, not just chat — it's the same function both already ran through for mentions/links,
         and there was no reason to fork a chat-only copy). Deliberately a simple regex pass, not
         a real markdown parser: a code span's content isn't protected from also matching the
         bold/italic regexes below it, an accepted rough edge for a low-stakes internal tool.
         Italic gets a word-boundary guard (`_` has to be preceded/followed by whitespace or
         string edges) that bold doesn't — underscores show up constantly in ordinary text and
         identifiers ("some_file_name" would otherwise italicize "file"), where asterisks
         essentially never do without real formatting intent. The compose box placeholder
         mentions the syntax directly, since there's no toolbar/buttons to discover it from.
       - **Pin messages** (`pinned`, an array of message ids on the same project doc `chat`/
         `links` already live on; `isMessagePinned`/`toggleMessagePin`) — distinct from the
         pre-existing "Pinned links" (a manually-curated URL list, unrelated to any one message).
         Someone had asked "can I pin messages" earlier in this project and the answer at the
         time was no; this is that feature. **Open to anyone, not author/admin-scoped** — pinning
         is fully reversible and never touches the message's own content or existence, closer in
         kind to reacting than to deleting. Needed **no `firestore.rules` change**: `pinned` is a
         brand new field the project doc's `chat`-focused update rule never restricts
         (`!changedKeys().hasAny(['chat'])` already passes when only `pinned` changes). Surfaced
         as its own strip above the message log (`#project-chat-pinned-wrap`, hidden entirely
         when nothing's pinned, same "don't show an empty state for something most chats won't
         use" reasoning as Pinned Links' own "no links pinned yet" — except this one hides the
         whole section rather than showing that line, since pinning is rarer still). Clicking a
         pinned entry scrolls the real message into view and gives it a brief highlight flash
         (`chat-message-jump-flash`, same "flash then fade" idea `checklist-check-pop` already
         established); a dangling pinned id (the message was since deleted) is silently filtered
         out when rendering the strip, same "don't guess, don't break" fallback a dangling
         `replyTo` already gets — the stale id itself is never pruned from the array, a minor,
         accepted bit of bloat rather than something worth a cleanup pass for.
       - **Edit a sent message** (`startChatEdit`/`saveChatEdit`, reusing the compose box itself
         rather than a separate inline editor) — own messages only, text-only (nothing to edit on
         an image). Mutually exclusive with replying: starting an edit cancels any in-progress
         reply and vice versa. Shows "(edited)" next to the timestamp once saved, Slack's own
         convention. **The "own message only" boundary is client-side only, same as reactions'
         own trust model, not a new gap this feature introduces.** Tightening it further turns
         out to be genuinely hard, not just undone: the existing `projects` update rule already
         has to allow a same-size `chat` array update for reactions (toggling one doesn't change
         `chat.size()`), and Firestore rules can't easily tell "someone else's reaction toggle"
         apart from "a content edit" within one array-diff check without risking false rejections
         on the reactions path, which *is* meant to be open to anyone regardless of message
         author. A determined bad actor bypassing the client could already rewrite any message's
         reactions this way before this feature existed; Edit just adds one more UI surface
         sitting on the same pre-existing allowance, not a new exposure.
       - **Mute a chat** (`mutedChats` on the signed-in person's own `people/{uid}` doc, same
         array-on-your-own-doc shape and rules-safety as `favoriteChats`/`chatLastRead` — no
         `firestore.rules` change needed) — the natural counterpart to "every message now
         notifies every project assignee" (see above): Slack always pairs broad default
         notifications with a per-channel mute. Silences the assignee-broadcast (`chat_post`) and
         reaction (`chat_reaction`) notifications a chat would otherwise send, but **never an
         actual `chat_mention`** — same "a mute doesn't block a direct mention" convention
         Slack/Discord both use, checked via `isPersonMutedOnChat` (reading the *recipient's* own
         `mutedChats` off the shared `teamPeople` roster from whoever's *sending* the message —
         `people` is already team-readable, so this needed no new read access either). Toggled
         via a bell/bell-off icon in the chat header; deliberately does **not** touch the unread
         dot/count or the sort tier — muting only silences pushes, the same way a muted Slack
         channel still shows unread in its own sidebar.
       - **Cross-chat search** (`findMatchingChatMessage`, folded into `renderChatProjectList`'s
         existing `filters.search` handling) — the project list's search box used to match only
         the project *name*; Slack searches every channel's *messages* at once. A chat now
         matches if its name matches OR any of its messages contain the term (most recent match
         first). When the hit came from message content rather than the name, the row's subtitle
         swaps from "the latest message" to "the message that actually matched" — Slack's own
         global search shows the matching snippet, not just "this channel contains your term
         somewhere" — falling back to the normal latest-message preview once the search box is
         cleared or the project name itself is what matched. This is a different, complementary
         search from the pre-existing `runChatSearch` ("search within the chat itself"), which
         only ever looked inside whichever ONE chat was already open — this one finds *which*
         chat to open in the first place.
   - **Task deep links** (`copyTaskLink`, the `#task=<id>` hash) — "point another user to a
     specific task card," built alongside the project chat above (a message can reference a
     task by pasting its link). `openTaskModal(task)` sets `#task=<id>` via
     `history.replaceState` (not `pushState`, so opening/closing tasks doesn't spam browser
     history) for every existing task it opens — not only when Copy Link is clicked — so the
     address bar is always a valid share link for whatever's open, and `closeTaskModal` clears
     it back to the plain path. `copyTaskLink` (the modal header's new link-icon button, next to
     the close button, hidden on a fresh "Add Task") just writes that same URL to the clipboard.
     - **Consuming the link on load has to wait for the first real `tasks` snapshot** — `tasks`
       starts as `[]`, so checking `location.hash` any earlier would always miss. Guarded by a
       one-time `deepLinkOpened` flag inside the `tasks` `onSnapshot` handler so a *later*
       snapshot (someone else's unrelated edit landing live) can't reopen a task the person
       already closed. A `hashchange` listener separately covers pasting a fresh `#task=` link
       into a tab that's already open, guarded against re-opening the task that's already open.
   - **Overtime is manually tagged** (`task-time-overtime`, `setOvertimeToggle`) — a plain toggle
     button next to Billable, same shape and pattern. It used to be auto-detected: crossing
     `OVERTIME_DAILY_MINUTES` (8h) in a person's cumulative logged time for the day popped an
     `openConfirm` at log time asking whether to mark it. That could fire on an unrelated small
     entry just because *earlier* entries the same day already pushed the total over 8h, and only
     ever checked the signed-in user's own name — not necessarily who the task was actually being
     logged against. A manual toggle is more predictable, at the cost of the automatic nudge that
     used to catch it even when nobody was thinking about it.
   - **General UI polish pass** — modals (task/confirm), every header dropdown (notification,
     digest, user menu, mention autocomplete, and every "enhanced select" filter/sort menu), and
     checklist items ticking done all got a subtle open/check animation, on top of the completion
     motivators above. Requested directly ("subtle animations that make the UI more pleasant to
     use") after noticing most of the app was otherwise instant on/off.
     - **Open-only, deliberately.** Closing still goes through a plain `hidden` toggle everywhere
       (backdrop click, Escape, Cancel, outside-click — many call sites per modal/panel). Adding a
       matching exit animation would mean every one of those delaying `classList.add('hidden')`
       by the animation's duration instead of adding it immediately, which is real extra
       bookkeeping repeated at every close site for comparatively little payoff — an abrupt close
       reads far less jarring than an abrupt open. `.modal-backdrop`/`.modal-pop-in`/
       `.panel-pop-in` all lean on a browser behavior that needs zero JS either way: a CSS
       `animation` on an element restarts on its own whenever that element's `display` flips from
       `none` to visible, so a permanent class on the modal/panel markup is enough — the same
       `[hidden] { display: none !important }` rule that already governs every toggle in this app
       is what makes this work.
     - **`justCheckedItemIds`** (checklist item id → `true`, TTL 500ms) is the same eager-flag
       pattern as `justCompletedIds` for the Board card pulse, scoped to checklist items instead
       of tasks: set in the `.checklist-toggle` change handler the moment an item goes from
       not-done to done, read by `renderChecklistEditor()` to add `.checklist-just-checked` (a
       brief green background flash) to that row on its next render.
     - All the new animation classes are covered by the existing
       `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block alongside the completion motivators.
   - **Second polish pass** — drag-and-drop, button presses, and the notification bell, added
     after the first pass was well received and asked to be extended:
     - **Dragging a card/checklist item** now has a smooth lift instead of an instant opacity
       snap (`.task-card.dragging` gains `transform: scale(1.02)` + a drop shadow;
       `.checklist-item-row.dragging` gets the same shadow treatment). `.task-card` already
       carried Tailwind's bare `transition` class from earlier work, so this needed no new
       transition rule; `.checklist-item-row` didn't, so it got one added explicitly. The Board
       column's drop-target highlight (`.col-drop-target`) also gained a `background-color`
       transition on `[data-column]` for the same reason — only the color is transitioned, not
       the outline, since `outline-style`/`width` don't animate reliably across browsers and the
       color fade alone already carries most of the visible effect.
     - **`button:not(:disabled):active { filter: brightness(0.9); }`** is global press feedback,
       deliberately using `filter` instead of `transform`. Flowboard doesn't have a shared
       `.btn`/`.icon-btn` class anywhere (unlike the sibling apps) — every button is raw Tailwind
       utilities — so a single global rule was the only way to cover all of them without editing
       every button's markup. `transform` was ruled out specifically because several buttons
       already use it for their own hover effect (e.g. the Focus-of-the-Day cards'
       `hover:-translate-y-0.5`), and a global `:active` transform would have silently replaced
       those instead of composing with them; `filter` composites independently, so it can't
       collide. Also deliberately *not* wrapped in its own `transition` rule — most buttons
       already carry Tailwind's bare `transition` class, whose default `transition-property` list
       already includes `filter`, so adding one here risked overwriting whatever properties an
       individual button's existing `transition` was actually covering (a bare CSS `transition`
       shorthand fully replaces the list, it doesn't merge with what's already declared).
     - **`#focus-list`'s `hover:-translate-y-0.5` lift was getting clipped against the strip's
       own top edge** (reported as "the animation for the focus of the day card when it moves up
       is cropped"). Root cause: `#focus-list` only set `overflow-x: auto` (for the horizontal
       card strip) and never touched `overflow-y` — but per the CSS spec, a horizontal-only
       `overflow-x: auto`/`overflow-y: visible` combination isn't legal, so the browser silently
       promotes the un-set axis from `visible` to `auto` too. With no top padding to spare, that
       auto vertical scrollbox clipped the 2px hover-lift the instant a card tried to rise above
       the container's own edge. Fixed with a small `pt-1.5` on `#focus-list`, not by touching the
       card's own transform — worth remembering for any other `overflow-x-auto` strip that also
       hosts a hover lift or similar upward transform (the People/Projects row strips don't use a
       lift-on-hover, so they weren't affected, but a future one would hit the same clipping).
     - **`nudgeNotificationBell()`** shakes `#btn-notifications` once per snapshot when a new
       *unread* notification actually lands via the `notifications` `onSnapshot` listener —
       same `notifListenerReady`-gated "added after the first snapshot" detection
       `fireDesktopNotification` already uses (see the comment there on why a ready-flag, not a
       timestamp comparison), called once per snapshot rather than once per new doc so a batch of
       several notifications (e.g. one comment mentioning three people) doesn't restart the shake
       repeatedly. Fires regardless of the desktop-notification opt-in, so it's the one new-
       activity cue everyone gets. The bell button is a persistent DOM node (never recreated),
       so this is a plain `classList` add/remove-after-timeout rather than the render-time flag
       pattern `justCompletedIds`/`justCheckedItemIds` use — no render pass needed to pick it up.
       The remove → forced reflow (`void btn.offsetWidth`) → re-add sequence lets the animation
       restart cleanly if a second notification arrives mid-shake, instead of the class-already-
       present no-op that a bare re-add would otherwise be.
   - **Third polish pass** — chat-specific animations plus one general one (field-validation
     shake), asked for as an open-ended "what other animations can I add" following by "build
     all" once a shortlist was offered:
     - **A new chat message fades/slides in on arrival** (`.chat-message-enter`,
       `@keyframes chat-message-in`) — but only a message this *specific chat* hasn't rendered
       before in this session, never the whole history on first open. `renderChatDetail` tracks
       this itself: `chatSeenMessageIds[projectName]` is `undefined` the first time a project's
       chat is rendered at all, in which case every message in it is marked seen with nothing
       animated (opening a chat with history shouldn't play the whole conversation sliding in);
       on every later render, only a message id not already in that project's seen-set is new,
       and it's added to the set either way. The set is keyed by project name and never reset —
       switching away and back to a chat shouldn't replay its entrance animation either.
     - **The read-receipt tick's single-to-double flip** (`.chat-receipt-flip`,
       `@keyframes chat-receipt-flip`) — same "don't animate what's already true on first load"
       discipline as the Board's own "N today" bounce badge: `chatReceiptSeenState[messageId]`
       has to be a known `false` (not `undefined`, i.e. not this message's first ever render) for
       the flip to fire, computed inline in `chatMessageHtml` right where `seen` itself is
       computed for the tick's read-receipts feature.
     - **A reaction pill pops in** (reusing `.chat-star-pop`'s own keyframe rather than a near-
       identical second one) the first render it exists on — `chatSeenReactionKeys`, keyed by
       `messageId + '|' + emoji` so the same emoji on two different messages animates
       independently, gated by the same per-chat "not on the very first render" flag threaded
       through from `renderChatDetail` as the message-entrance animation above.
     - **Favouriting a chat pops the star** (`.chat-star-pop`) — applied directly in
       `#chat-project-list`'s click handler, not inferred from a render diff like the three
       animations above. This one's simpler because the click itself is the moment worth
       celebrating, and the exact button element being animated gets thrown away and rebuilt the
       moment the Firestore round-trip the click triggers re-renders the list anyway — no
       remove-reflow-add dance needed the way `nudgeNotificationBell`'s repeatable-trigger case
       needs one, since there's no "already has the class" state to ever collide with.
     - **The typing indicator is three bouncing dots, not a static "…"**
       (`renderProjectChatTypingIndicator`, `.chat-typing-dots`, `@keyframes chat-typing-bounce`)
       — the universal chat-app convention. Switched `#project-chat-typing` from `.textContent`
       to `.innerHTML` to insert the dots' markup, so display names now go through `escapeHtml`
       explicitly (textContent used to do this for free); the three dots stagger via inline
       `animation-delay` set directly in the generated HTML rather than three separate named
       classes.
     - **The four chat-specific floating panels never actually got the header-dropdown pop-in
       animation the first UI polish pass gave every *other* menu/panel in the app** — noticed
       while building the animations above, not separately reported. `#chat-reaction-picker`,
       `#chat-new-menu`, `#chat-forward-menu`, and `#chat-message-menu` all predate that first
       pass's sweep (they were built afterward, as the chat feature grew) and were still
       instant on/off. Each just needed `panel-pop-in` added to its static class list — the
       animation restarts on its own whenever `display` flips from `none` to visible, so no JS
       change was needed, same as every other panel that already had it.
     - **An invalid required field shakes on a failed Save** (`.field-shake`,
       `@keyframes field-shake`) — added to `setFieldError`, the one function every task-modal
       validation failure already funnels through. Same remove-reflow-add sequence as
       `nudgeNotificationBell`, needed here because a person can fail validation on the *same*
       field twice in a row (fix one field, still leave another empty, Save again) — a bare
       `classList.add` would silently no-op the second time since the class from the first
       failure is often still present. `clearFieldErrors` also strips `field-shake` from every
       field alongside the existing rose border/ring classes it already resets, for hygiene —
       not strictly required, since the animation is one-shot and doesn't loop, but keeps a
       cleared field's class list from accumulating a stale animation class it'll never need
       again until the next real failure re-adds it.
     - All seven join the existing `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block.
   - **Fourth polish pass — animations that say what changed** (picked from a shortlist as the
     ones that help UX, not just looks; all in the reduced-motion block):
     - **A teammate's edit flashes the row** (`noteRemoteTaskChanges` in the `tasks` listener,
       `remoteFlashAttrs`, `.remote-change-flash`) on Board rows and WIP By-project task rows.
       Only other clients' changes count: own writes arrive with `hasPendingWrites` and the
       server ack raises no new snapshot on this default listener. The first snapshot and any
       snapshot touching more than 8 tasks (import, Archive completed) flash nothing. The flash
       carries a negative `animation-delay` of its age, so a re-render mid-flash (presence
       heartbeat) continues it instead of restarting it. The completion pulse wins if both apply.
     - **"Saved" pill after WIP inline edits** (`showSavedTick`, `.saved-tick`), body-level and
       `position: fixed` like the tooltips, placed from the edited field's rect captured before
       the save re-renders it away. Only on a real write (`wipSaveEdit`'s promise), never on the
       "nothing changed" early exits. Project deadlines already toast, so they don't get it.
     - **Unfolding sections fade in on open only** (`markJustOpened` / `openAnimClass`,
       `.expand-in`, `.expand-fade` for the sticky Timeline cells where a transform is unsafe):
       WIP project fold and Expand all, Needs a decision, Contact & links, Projects cards, and
       checklist rows on both timelines. Time-boxed (400ms) rather than consumed, so whichever
       render actually paints the section gets the class. Closing stays instant, same open-only
       rule as the modals.
8. **Live listeners** — `startListeners`/`stopListeners` wire up four `onSnapshot` subscriptions
   (`tasks`, `activity`, a per-user `notifications` query, and `suggestions`), gated by
   `onAuthStateChanged`.
9. **Version-poll auto-reload** — see Deploying above.

### App shell: sidebar nav, not a horizontal tab row

`#app` is a top-level flex **row**, not a flex column: `<aside id="sidebar">` beside a
`<div class="flex-1 ... flex flex-col overflow-hidden">` holding the (now much slimmer) `<header>`
and `<main>`. This replaced a single flex-column page where 8 view tabs, search, four filters, and
half a dozen action buttons all lived in one horizontal header — reported directly as too much
crammed into one strip. Agreed on via an interactive mockup (a separate, standalone artifact) before
touching this file, per standing collaborate-before-building feedback — see that memory if this
needs revisiting.

- **Nav is the one thing that actually moved to the sidebar.** The 8 `.view-toggle-btn` buttons
  (same `data-view-btn` attribute, same click wiring, same icons) now live in a vertical
  `<nav>` instead of `#view-tab-row`'s horizontal track. `setView()` used to toggle 7 individual
  Tailwind utility classes per button (`bg-white`/`shadow-card`/`text-brand-700`/etc. — shaped for
  a white pill floating on a grey track) — now toggles a single `.active` class, with
  `.view-toggle-btn`/`.view-toggle-btn.active`/`:hover` rules in the styles block deciding what
  that looks like for a rail item instead.
- **Notification/digest bells stayed in the top header; account (avatar, theme toggle, sign out)
  moved to the sidebar's bottom.** This was the one deliberate relocation beyond "nav moved,"
  matching the Slack/Linear/Notion split: bells are glanced at from wherever you are and shouldn't
  need a side panel open; identity/settings are "set once, rarely touched." `#user-menu-panel`'s
  own markup/ids/content are untouched — only its position rule flipped from `top-full mt-1
  right-0` to `bottom-full mb-1 left-2`, since its trigger now sits near the bottom of the
  viewport instead of the top.
- **The header is no longer `position: sticky`.** It's a `shrink-0` flex sibling stacked above
  the scrolling `<main>` inside the same overflow-hidden column as the sidebar, which pins it at
  the top by construction — sticky positioning was only ever needed back when header+main
  **(The footer itself was removed on 2026-10-06, on request: "why is this necessary?". It repeated
  the app name, said "Firestore", and restated who is signed in, all already on screen.)**
  scrolled together as one ordinary page. `<footer>` moved from a sibling of `<main>` to the last
  thing *inside* it, so it's still only seen by actually scrolling to the end (unchanged
  behavior), not turned into a permanently-visible status bar.
- **Sidebar collapse (icon-only rail) is one class, one CSS custom property.** `#sidebar.collapsed`
  swaps a single width via a CSS custom property (`--` not used directly — width is just two
  fixed values, expanded vs. collapsed, on the class selector) and fades `.sidebar-label` spans to
  `opacity:0` — nothing computed or re-applied from JS per click. Persisted to `localStorage`
  (`flowboard_sidebar_collapsed`), restored immediately on load (no auth dependency, unlike
  everything else that waits on `onAuthStateChanged`).
- **Below 767px, the sidebar becomes an off-canvas drawer** (`position: fixed`, `translateX(-100%)`
  by default, slides in on `#app.sidebar-open`) with a dedicated `#sidebar-backdrop` — replacing
  the old `#mobile-view-trigger`, which toggled `#view-tab-row`'s own `hidden` class inline rather
  than sliding anything. The drawer closes on: picking a view (`setView()`), tapping the backdrop,
  or Escape (added to the existing task-modal/confirm-modal Escape handler for the same reason
  those get it — a backdropped overlay should close on Escape). `#sb-collapse-btn` itself is
  `hidden` below `md:`, so "collapsed" and "drawer open" can never be a state to reason about at
  the same time — a stale `collapsed` class surviving a resize down to mobile width is overridden
  back to full labels by the mobile media query (same specificity, later in the stylesheet, wins
  when its condition matches).
- **Verified against the real file, not just the standalone mockup**, before shipping: a scratch
  copy with the auth gate forced open and the real (Firebase-importing) module script swapped for
  a tiny stand-in wiring only the collapse/drawer/nav-click behavior under test, screenshotted in
  light, dark, collapsed, and mobile-drawer states. Still not a live-browser/Firestore check (no
  emulator in this environment) — worth a real click-through after deploying.
- **Superseded (2026-10-06): Export/Import now live in the profile menu under "Data"**, same ids
  (`#btn-export`/`#btn-import`), each closing the menu on click. See "Sidebar groups" below.
  Original note:
- **Export/Import moved from the header's icon row into the sidebar nav** (direct request), as two
  more `view-toggle-btn`-styled rows below a divider after Archived, `#btn-export`/`#btn-import`/
  `#import-file-input` ids all unchanged so none of their click handlers needed touching. Reusing
  `.view-toggle-btn` is purely cosmetic here — `setView`'s active-state toggle only ever matches
  elements by their `data-view-btn` attribute, which these two buttons deliberately don't have, so
  they get the same hover/tooltip look as a real nav item without ever being able to light up as
  one. Moved because they're occasional whole-board backup/restore actions, not something reached
  for as often as the header's bells or Add Task.
- **Floating tooltips (`data-tooltip` + a `tooltip-right`/`tooltip-top` class) are JS-driven, not
  CSS.** Requested directly, for two spots reported in the same message: the sidebar's icon-only
  collapsed rail (nothing labels an icon once `.sidebar-label` is hidden) and a truncated Gantt
  project badge (`projectColor` — see the Gantt section below).
  - **First shipped covering only the Gantt badge, then reported back as still not working —
    it wasn't broken, it just didn't cover what "long titles" actually meant.** The request read
    as one bug about one already-demonstrated spot; it was actually "cards with long titles" in
    general, which the Gantt row (not visually a card) never implied covering. Verified the
    shipped Gantt tooltip really did work first — a real-DOM Playwright test against this exact
    file (auth gate forced open, `#app` unhidden, a synthetic row injected into `#gantt-wrap`)
    showed the full text rendering correctly — before concluding the gap was coverage, not a
    regression. Extended `data-tooltip`/`tooltip-top` to every truncated card/title in the same
    pass: `boardTaskRowHtml`'s task name, `projectGroupCardHtml`'s project header, the Focus of
    the Day card name, and the People and Projects tab card headers (`p.name`/`g.project`). If a
    new card shows a name with `truncate` or `line-clamp-*`, give it `data-tooltip` too — this
    class of "the label just got cut off" report has now happened twice.
  - **A pure `::after`-based tooltip was the first attempt, and it doesn't work here.** The
    sidebar's own `<nav>` (`overflow-y-auto`) and each Gantt row's label cell (`overflow-hidden`)
    both clip an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element the moment it visually pokes outside their
    box — this is true *regardless* of the fact that the pseudo-element's own containing block
    (for `left`/`top` purposes) is the hovered element itself, not that ancestor. Overflow clips
    rendered descendants unconditionally; it has nothing to do with what establishes their
    positioning context. Confirmed with an isolated two-case test (a button inside a
    scroll-clipped `<nav>`, a badge inside an `overflow-hidden` cell) before writing the real
    fix, since this is exactly the kind of thing that looks correct in the markup and is silently
    invisible in the browser.
  - **The fix: one tooltip `<div>` appended directly to `<body>`**, moved with real pixel
    coordinates (`position: fixed`, computed from `getBoundingClientRect()` on hover) rather than
    living inside either clipped ancestor's DOM subtree at all. `positionTooltip()` reads a
    `tooltip-top`/`tooltip-right` class off the *target* to decide which side to render on;
    `tooltipSuppressed()` gates sidebar tooltips to only fire while `#sidebar` actually has
    `.collapsed` — expanded, a nav item's own visible label already says what it is, and (more
    importantly) the collapse button's tooltip text ("Expand sidebar") would otherwise describe
    the wrong action while the sidebar is still expanded, since clicking it there collapses,
    not expands.
  - Delayed on the way in (`setTimeout(..., 300)`, so an incidental mouse pass doesn't flash a
    tooltip) but instant on the way out (`hideTooltip()` called directly from `mouseout`), same
    asymmetry native browser tooltips use. Re-verified the real fix with the same isolated
    two-case test before wiring it into this file — both now render the full text outside their
    respective clipped ancestor, escaping correctly in both directions.
  - **`positionTooltip()`'s `tooltip-top` branch only clamped the left edge, not the right.**
    Never mattered while the Gantt project badge was the only `tooltip-top` user — it always sits
    in the frozen left column, nowhere near the right edge of the viewport. The Gantt's own
    "Progress" toggle (`#gantt-progress-toggle`, replacing its native `title` with `data-tooltip`
    on request, same swap `#sb-collapse-btn` got) sits at the *right* end of the chart's legend
    row, and a tooltip long enough to need centering there ran its right edge straight off-screen.
    Caught from an actual screenshot, not just the passing DOM check — the check only confirms a
    tooltip element exists with the right text, not that it's fully visible. Fixed by clamping
    both edges: `Math.min(centeredLeft, window.innerWidth - tr.width - 4)` before the existing
    `Math.max(4, ...)`.
- **Search + the priority/project/people/sort toolbar moved out of `<header>` entirely, into
  `<main>`, right after `#focus-section`.** It used to share a row with the header's own
  title/stats, directly under it — reported directly as too much crammed under a line that was
  already asking for attention. `#focus-section` (Focus of the Day) has no `data-view` gate and
  already rendered above every view, not just Board, so putting the toolbar right after it gives
  every one of the 8 views the same shared row in the same place, not something Board-specific.
  The row is `justify-end` (right-aligned) with `#filter-search` first, then priority/project/
  people/sort — matching how they read left to right, narrow-to-scoped.
  - **`order-2` alone wasn't enough to put search first — needed `sm:order-first`.**
    `#filters-panel` (holding the four dropdowns) is `sm:contents` at that breakpoint, which pulls
    its children out to become direct flex items of the row *without* inheriting the panel's own
    `order-3` — they fall back to the default `order: 0`, which beats a merely-numbered `order-2`
    search box. Order beat this the same reasoning way CSS overflow beat the tooltip fix above:
    looks correct in the markup, wrong on screen. Caught by actually reading each control's
    rendered `left` position in a real-DOM Playwright check, not by eyeballing a screenshot.
  - IDs, event listeners, and the mobile collapsible-filters-trigger pattern (`#mobile-filters-
    trigger` / `#filters-panel.hidden` toggle) are untouched — nothing in the JS queries these by
    position or by `header`, so relocating the markup needed no script changes at all.
  - **`#toolbar-row` gets a `border-t` + `pt-4`**, separate from the `gap-6` `<main>` already
    puts between sections — Focus of the Day and this row are both dense, and ran together
    without something marking the boundary (reported directly, same message as the header
    alignment fix below).
  - **On Activity, Priority/Project/People hide entirely (`filter-priority-wrap` /
    `filter-project-wrap` / `filter-people-wrap`, toggled by `syncToolbarLayout()`, called
    alongside `syncSortAvailability()`/`syncSearchAvailability()` from `setView()`) and the row
    switches from `justify-end` to `justify-center`.** Same reasoning `renderActivityFeed`
    already gives for skipping `applyFilters()` — those three describe tasks, and Activity isn't
    a task list — but reported separately once they sat there fully clickable and doing nothing,
    the same "control present, wired to nothing" gap Sort had. Search and Sort both stay: they
    actually work on Activity (search filters the log, Sort does Newest/Oldest — see the Sort
    section above), so only the three inert controls are hidden, not the whole row. Recentering
    when only two controls remain keeps the row from reading as "most of a toolbar went
    missing" flush against the right edge.
- **The header row is a fixed `h-16`, matching the sidebar's own brand-row height exactly** (the
  `<aside>`'s own `h-16` div), so their bottom borders meet at the same y-position across the
  full page width. It used to be `py-3` with no explicit height, which happened to render at
  ~60px against the sidebar's fixed 64px — 4px off, close enough to look accidental rather than
  intentional, and reported directly from a screenshot as needing to look neater. If either
  row's content ever needs to grow taller than 64px, both heights need to move together or this
  drifts out of alignment again.

### Features in sync (2026-10-07)

Asked: "Make sure all the features in the PM tool work together syncronisingly and not in
separately", then "make this a rule" (see the standing rule near the top). A four-part audit
(duplicate data, names as links, live refresh, phone vs desktop side effects) found these, all fixed:

- **The open task window no longer undoes other people's changes.** It used to write the whole
  form back on Save (last write wins), so a step ticked on a phone, a status moved on the Board or
  steps added from a brief were undone by any unrelated edit. Now (`taskOpenBase`,
  `syncOpenTaskFromServer`, `mergeChecklist`, `mergeTimeEntries`): changes made elsewhere show in
  the open window live; a field you didn't touch takes the server's value; Save writes only fields
  that differ from the server, with checklist and time entries three-way merged (by step id; time
  entries by identical-entry counts). Lists don't merge while a step or time entry is being edited
  (the re-render would close it); Save merges anyway. Merged-in items are copies, never the board's
  own objects (sharing them made an edit also change Save's "before" and silently skip the write).
  Changes that arrived from elsewhere don't trigger "Discard changes?".
- **Step ids are written on open** when a task has steps saved before ids existed, and the phone
  finds such a step by position ("@3") and writes ids in the same tick. Before, a phone tick on an
  old step did nothing, and the task window re-sent "assigned you" for every step with people.
- **One spelling per project** (`canonicalProjectName`, `projectKey`): "acme  rebrand" snaps to an
  existing "Acme Rebrand" (task window, phone quick add, WIP "+ Add entry"; import strips and trims);
  `projectDeadlineDoc` falls back to the same match. Fixing the capitals on a project's only task is
  a rename, not snapped back.
- **Renaming a project keeps its chat, brief, deadline and WIP entry** (`carryProjectDocOnRename`):
  once no task (active or archived) uses the old name, its project doc takes the new name; your own
  chat read/favourite/mute marks move too. Not done if the new name already has a doc. Logged as
  `project_renamed`.
- **Monday "on leave" is booked leave.** "I'm on leave this week" is pre-ticked from People > Time
  off, and sending it with no leave booked adds a Mon-Fri period (note "From Monday update"),
  removed again if unticked and sent. Away = leave covering the whole Mon-Fri week. Away people
  don't count in "N of M in" and get no Friday or Monday reminder.
- **Monday "late" uses `dueUrgency`** (a task in Review isn't late, as on the board), and last week's
  rows are carried only for projects still live (`weeklyProjectStillOpen`: on the board and not
  fully archived, or a WIP entry).
- **One "late step" rule: `stepIsLate(t, item)`** (`ganttItemLate` now calls it), also used by the
  task window's "Due" line, People step rows and brief key dates.
- **Brief key dates follow the checklist**: a date that became a step shows the step's date and
  status (an open one speaks for a name on several tasks; a step on a Completed task is done), and
  the brief card re-renders live while open (`renderAll`). Steps added from a brief are logged.
- **Phone status to Review asks "Client or internal review?"**, as on the Board; a failed status
  write puts the phone's buttons back.
- **Import keeps `completedAt` and `reviewAudience`.** The calendar day pop-up refreshes live.
- **Built after, on the owner's go-ahead:** Monday "Needs help" rows show on WIP Meeting
  (`weeklyHelpByProject`: each person's newest update, this meeting week or last; a "Needs help" chip
  on the folded header, or a line naming who needs what when open, never both) and on the phone's
  project page; the Monday editor notes "N tasks here are still open on the board" when Done is
  picked (`weeklyOpenTaskCount`); Calendar "Mine" counts tasks you're also involved in. WIP's folded
  "behind" count now uses `stepIsLate`.
- **Still not done (later decisions):** involved-only people in the This Week digest and People card
  (by design: involved isn't workload); a display-name change
  re-mapping old names (needs an admin path); time logging and archiving on the phone.
- Verified in Chromium with the in-memory stand-in plus a remote-edit hook (16 checks), and the
  earlier suites still pass (phone 25/25 with the new review question answered; the Monday suite's
  "Chloe away" check now expects "not away" for a Tue-Fri leave).

### Expressive UI pass (2026-10-07)

Asked: "how can the PM's UI be more expressive? This needs to add to the usability and not hinder or
serve as a distraction ... more pleasant and delightful to use", then "go with your recommendations".
Each item had to help at the moment of use and add nothing at rest.

- **Undo instead of "Are you sure?"** for reversible actions: archiving a task (Board row), "Archive
  completed", archiving a project (`confirmArchiveProject`), removing a checklist step, removing a time
  entry (a group's toast says "Removed 3h for 3 people"). `showToast(msg, type, {action: {label, onClick}})`
  stays 7s. `restoreArchivedTasks(list)` puts tasks back from the objects captured before archiving
  (rules allow the move back for anyone via `existsAfter(tasks/..)`). Step/time Undo only applies while the
  same task window is open. Permanent deletes (task, comment, chat message, suggestion) keep their confirm;
  status moves get no toast (a toast per move was rejected earlier as fatigue).
- **Glide (FLIP)**: `flipCapture`/`flipPlay` around `renderBoard` (keyed by `data-task-id`) and
  `renderChecklistEditor` (`data-flip` = step id): anything that moved slides from its old spot (220ms).
  Nothing new pops in; off under reduced motion.
- **Ctrl K / Cmd K quick jump** (`cmdk*`, built in JS): pages, tasks, projects (opens the Projects card,
  expanded and flashed), chats. Nothing typed = your next open tasks, then pages. Not on the phone layout,
  not while a modal is open. A "Ctrl K" hint in the search box opens it; its CHANGELOG item has a
  `tourTarget` so existing users get one "Show me".
- **Empty states say what goes there**: Board columns per status ("Nothing waiting on review. Nice."), or
  "Nothing here with the current filters" when filters/teamspace narrow the board; Projects (with an "Add a
  task" button), Archived, the bell ("You're all caught up."), task-window steps and comments.
- Verified in Chromium (17 checks) plus the earlier suites.

### Repeats, copied steps and review rounds (2026-10-08)

Asked to compare against TeamGantt, Monday, Notion and the like ("what else can be learnt?"), then "go
with your recommendations". Three things that remove work rather than add it:

- **Repeating tasks** (Asana/Monday/Todoist "repeat when completed"). `task.repeat` = weekly |
  fortnightly | monthly, set from a quiet select in the Deadline label row (`#task-repeat`; TBD clears and
  disables it; a repeat needs a deadline). **No scheduler**: completing the task makes the next one, inside
  `statusTransitionEffects` (5th arg `taskNow`), so the Board drag, the task window and the phone all do
  it. The next task (`repeatNextTask`) copies name, project, owner, involved, priority, link and steps
  (unticked, dates shifted by the same amount), status Pipeline, none of the history; its deadline is the
  next date in the series that is today or later (finishing late never makes an overdue task); monthly
  keeps the day (`repeatDay`: 31 Jan, 28 Feb, 31 Mar). **Written in the same batch as the completion**, so
  the "project complete" celebration and the archive prompt never see the project as finished (and
  `willFinishProject` is false for a repeat). The completed task's `repeat` becomes null, so moving it
  out of Done and back makes nothing; the id is fixed per series (`<root>-r<n>`), so two people
  completing it at once write one task. Toast with Undo (deletes the next, restores the repeat); logged as
  `task_created`. No "assigned you" notifications for it. Loop icon on the Board row, "Repeats …" chip on
  the phone.
- **Copy steps from a similar task** (task templates, but any earlier task is the template, so nothing to
  set up or maintain). Offered from the checklist's empty state only (`#checklist-copy-btn` opens
  `#checklist-copy-pop`, on body like the people list). Same project first, then most recent; archived
  tasks load on open; a repeating series is listed once. Steps keep their people and their distance from
  this task's deadline (from the start date if there's no deadline yet); weekend dates move back to
  Friday; links are not copied. Undo on the toast. People are notified on Save as for any step.
- **Review rounds** (agency proofing tools). Every move into Review appends `{at, audience}` to
  `task.reviewRounds` (in `statusTransitionEffects`); the client/internal answer is filed on the latest
  round through `setReviewAudience` (Board drop, phone, the card label) or the task-window save, so
  changing the label corrects a round instead of adding one. **Client and internal are counted apart.**
  The label reads "Client review" for round 1 and "Client round 2" from the second
  (`reviewAudienceLabel`; also the phone chip and WIP's stuck-in-review line); the task window shows
  "Review rounds so far: 3 client, 1 internal" once either reaches 2. Counting starts now; older tasks
  have no history.
- Import keeps all the new fields. Verified in Chromium (`tests/repeat-copy-rounds.test.js`, 33 checks,
  light and dark screenshots).

### Dropdowns and the project's Drive folder (2026-10-08)

- **One dropdown list everywhere** (reported from a screenshot of the Repeat menu: "Drop down menus
  should be visually consistent"). `enhanceSelect` covers the toolbar and main task-form selects; every
  other desktop `<select>` (Repeat, "+ Add" people pickers in the task window, step editor and time
  row, brief rows, the admin's suggestion status, and any added later) now opens `#select-menu`
  (`openSelectMenu`): the same look as the enhanced menus, on `<body>`, `position: fixed`, z-[70].
  Document-level capture listeners: mousedown on a select opens it (and stops the native list),
  Enter/Space/F4/Alt+Arrow open it from the keyboard, arrows move, Enter picks, Escape closes only the
  list. **Focus stays on the select** (the menu's mousedown is prevented), so the step editor, which
  saves on focusout, doesn't close mid-pick. Picking sets the value and fires input + change, so no
  handler changed. Phones and touch screens (`pointer: coarse`) keep the native picker;
  `data-native-select` opts one out. The involved "+ Add" now calls `openSelectMenu` instead of
  `showPicker()`. The rule is in the shared `/design-check` checklist.
- **The Drive folder is encouraged, by deriving it first** (asked: "drive folder link should be
  encouraged"; Monday/Asana show an empty "+ Add" slot). `projectFolderFor(name)` finds the folder on
  any other task in the project (matched like `canonicalProjectName`: case and spaces ignored); the
  task window fills it in on open and as the project name is typed (`deriveProjectFolder`), marked
  "from this project", and Save stores it on the task. A folder filled in that way follows the name;
  one pasted or browsed by hand never changes; Remove means "no folder" for that visit. With no folder
  anywhere in the project, the helper line is an "Add the Drive folder" button (the Drive picker)
  plus "or paste its link above", instead of a grey hint. Phone quick add takes the project's folder
  too. Still stored per task (`driveLink`); a project-level field would be the bigger "one fact, one
  place" fix if it's ever needed.

### Mobile app (phones, below 768px)

Asked: "The mobile view is horrible. Interfaces overlap each other, scrolling is a pain ... I don't
need it to function 100% the same way as desktop. It should only be editable in key and simple
areas and the main objective of it is to get information on the go ... like a polished native
mobile app instead of a web app." The old phone view was the desktop squeezed: the header, filters,
search and Focus of the Day took half the screen on every page, the Board and Timeline scrolled
sideways inside the page, and the task window was the full desktop form.

- **A separate layout, not responsive tweaks to the desktop pages.** `#m-app` (the MOBILE APP section
  of the script, `.m-*` CSS in the style block) is drawn from the same live data; `html.m-mode` hides
  `#app`. `#m-app` must stay the next sibling of `#app` (the CSS hides it while `#app` is hidden, i.e.
  signed out). Plain CSS rather than Tailwind for the shell: blurred bars, safe areas, pushed screens
  and sheets need control the utilities don't give, and it avoids the CDN cascade-order problem.
- **Shape:** a tab bar (Home, Tasks, Calendar, Chat, More), large titles that collapse into the bar
  on scroll, screens that slide in from the right (back button, left-edge swipe, or the phone's own
  back via `history.pushState`/`popstate`), bottom sheets with a drag handle. Each tab is its own
  scroller, so switching tabs keeps your place; tapping the active tab scrolls to the top.
  - **Home:** greeting, three tiles (overdue / due this week / open), the Monday update card
    (Write/Edit), Needs attention (your overdue + due by tomorrow), Your steps (checklist steps due
    within a week, tickable), Later this week, Away.
  - **Tasks:** Mine / Everyone + search, grouped Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, Next 7 days, Later, In
    review, No date. **Calendar:** a week strip and day-by-day agenda from `cal2Collect` (late work
    carried to today). **Chat:** chat list with unread counts, WhatsApp-style thread, send text.
  - **More:** Monday Meeting (reuses `weeklyCardHtml`), WIP Meeting (read-only: Needs a decision +
    projects by category with the latest status line), People and person pages (tasks, steps, leave,
    an Email button), Projects and project pages (folder, chat, notes, tasks), Notifications, What's
    new, Dark mode, Use desktop layout, Sign out.
- **The only edits on a phone** (decided from the ask): tick a checklist step, move a task's
  status, post a status update (a sheet; same `addTaskStatus` as WIP), comment, send a chat message
  or a photo (the photo button beside the box; shrunk and uploaded like a desktop paste, shown as
  "Sending photo…" meanwhile, tap a photo for the full-screen viewer; **hidden while
  `CHAT_IMAGES_ENABLED` is off**, see "Chat image sharing"), @mention in chat and comments
  (the desktop's `wireMentionAutocomplete` with phone-sized rows, `.m-mention`), write the Monday update (the desktop editor, full screen), quick-add a task (name, project, owner,
  deadline, priority; created exactly like the desktop's new-task save). **Everything else stays on
  desktop**; a task's "..." > **Open full editor** opens the desktop task window as the escape hatch.
- **`openTaskModal` routes to the phone task screen** while `mActive()` (a task) or to quick add (no
  task), unless `mFullEditor` is set. So notifications, deep links (`#task=`) and anything else that
  opens a task land in the right place without each knowing about phones.
- **Company-wide, and the desktop's saved filters are ignored** (`mWithPlain` swaps `filters`,
  `currentTeamspace` and `calendarScope` for the call): a phone has nowhere to show them, and a
  hidden filter silently hiding tasks is the one thing a read-on-the-go view can't afford.
- **Guided tours don't run on a phone** (`maybeStartTour`/`maybeStartPageTour` return early): they
  point at the desktop layout.
- **Notification wording is shared** (`notificationHeadlineHtml`), so the bell and the phone list
  can't drift.
- **Switches:** `MOBILE_APP_ENABLED = false` turns it off for everyone. Per person: More > Use
  desktop layout (`flowboard_mobile_desktop` in localStorage), and back via the profile menu's
  "Use mobile layout" (`#btn-use-mobile`, created by JS, only on a phone-sized screen).
- **Home-screen ready:** `viewport-fit=cover` + safe-area padding, apple/mobile web-app meta tags,
  `interactive-widget=resizes-content`; on iOS the composer is lifted above the keyboard via
  `visualViewport` (`--m-kb`). The status-bar colour follows the phone layout's background.
- **Verified in Chromium at 390x844 with touch, light and dark**, against the real page with the
  in-memory Firestore stand-in (23 checks: every tab and screen renders, ticking a step, status,
  comment, status update, chat send, quick add, Monday editor, notification to chat, browser back
  pops a screen, no sideways scroll, desktop layout returns at 1280px), and the existing 58-check
  desktop suite still passes. **Not yet tried on a real iPhone/Android**; the iOS keyboard handling
  in particular is worth a real check.

**Long project names and zero-width spaces.** `projectNameHtml` marks break points (camelCase,
letter/number, `_ - /`, either side of the `[Client]` tag) with a zero-width space, not `<wbr>`:
Chromium breaks at a `<wbr>` even inside `white-space: nowrap`, which turned one-line truncated labels
into two or three lines (measured). A zero-width space respects nowrap. Because it would ride along
on copy, a document `copy` handler strips it, and every project-name save strips it (`stripZwsp`):
the task form, quick add and WIP's "+ Add entry". **Any new place that saves a project name typed
by hand should strip it too**, or a pasted name becomes a different project.

### Sidebar groups (named, 11 rows)

Asked directly: "how can I categorize these items or make this side bar better?", then "build all".

- **Each group title has a line under it** (asked: "Can a line divider be under the title so it is
  clear?"): `border-b` on the `.sidebar-label` heading itself, so it disappears with the label on
  the collapsed rail.
- **Every group is named; the labels replace the dividers.** Work (Board, Timeline, Calendar,
  Projects) · Team (People, Chat) · Meetings (WIP Meeting; was "Events", too vague) · History
  (Activity, Archived). Before, only Events had a label, so nothing said why Activity sat beside
  Suggestions. Labels are `.sidebar-label`, so the icon-only rail hides them.
- **New Updates and Suggestions sit in the footer, above Collapse**, beside the account. They are
  about the app, not the work: where Slack/Linear keep "What's new" and "Send feedback".
- **Export/Import are in the profile menu under "Data"** ("Export board" / "Import board"): rare
  whole-board actions that had two prime rows and a divider. 13 rows down to 11.
- **Icons:** Projects is a folder (was a clock, which says "time"); Timeline is three staggered
  Gantt bars (was a document glyph, also used in its page header and `ICONS.gantt`, all three
  replaced).
- **Unread New Updates no longer tints the row.** The tinted, glowing, light-sweep row looked
  exactly like `.view-toggle-btn.active` ("is that the page I'm on?"). Still prominent, as
  originally asked, via orange label text, the pulsing count and the ringing megaphone; just not
  a background. **Then made flashier on request, and is now a SOLID Poppy-to-indigo gradient bar** (white text, white
  count, ringing megaphone; asked "should it use a solid bar?"). This does not break the rule above: the
  problem was a *pale tint*, identical to the selected page. A full-strength bar is a different thing.
  Gradient, not solid Poppy, because solid Poppy is the primary-button colour (Add Task). Styled via
  `#updates-nav-btn` so it beats `.view-toggle-btn:hover` later in the sheet. On the collapsed rail
  the count moves to the bar's corner so it doesn't cover the megaphone. A moving gradient outline
  plus label shine shipped first and was replaced the same day.
  **The bar moves** ("I prefer motion though"): the gradient drifts (`--uf`, an `@property`) and a
  light streak sweeps across every 3.6s, both as background layers so no `overflow:hidden` clips the
  corner count. Its own reduced-motion rule, since the shared block can't beat the id selector.
  **The owner prefers motion over a static treatment for attention cues.**
- **On the collapsed rail, the teamspace menu opens BESIDE the rail at 13rem** (`#sidebar.collapsed
  #teamspace-menu` in the styles). It spans its wrapper (`left-2 right-2`), i.e. the sidebar's width,
  which on the rail cut every name to one letter (reported from a screenshot). The mobile drawer
  resets it, since `collapsed` is ignored there.

### Top bar (header review, 2026-10-06)

Asked "what can be improved here?" against a 4K screenshot, then "build all seven".

- **Toolbar joins the header row on wide screens** (`placeToolbar`, from `TOOLBAR_INLINE_MIN` 1600px). The
  `#toolbar-row` node is *moved* into `#header-row-inner` before `#header-actions` (ids and listeners
  travel with it) and gets `.toolbar-inline`. Content-aware: if `#header-row-inner` wraps
  (`offsetHeight > 56`) it goes straight back to its own row. Called on resize (debounced), from
  `syncToolbarLayout`, `renderStats` and `renderFilterOptions`. Below 1600px nothing changes.
- **Stats have no coloured dots.** The amber "high priority" dot clashed with amber = Medium
  everywhere else. Only the overdue number is coloured (rose, when above 0). Any stat at 0 hides.
- **"overdue" and "high priority" are filter buttons** (`.stat-chip`, `aria-pressed`). High sets
  `filters.priority`; overdue toggles `filters.overdueOnly`, which is **session-only** (`loadFilters`
  never restores it), counts toward Clear filters, and is applied in `applyFilters`. From a view
  that doesn't filter tasks, a click goes to the Board.
- **Filters are outlined at rest, brand-tinted when set** (`.filter-pill`/`.filter-pill-set`, set by
  `enhanceSelect`'s `sync()` for toolbar triggers only; "set" = not the first option). The People
  trigger is toggled in `renderFilterOptions`. Before, four solid grey boxes looked like four filters on.
- **This Week uses a checklist icon**, not the calendar glyph the Calendar page already uses.
- **Sidebar title is "Project Manager"** (was "MS Project Manager", which reads as Microsoft Project);
  `manifest.json` `short_name` too.
- **Search placeholders are short** ("Search…", "Search people…"); the full scope of each view's
  search is in the input's tooltip (`syncSearchAvailability`).
- **Teamspace button**: light fill and a firmer border so it lifts off the sidebar; icon centred on
  the collapsed rail (`#sidebar.collapsed #teamspace-trigger`).

### Creative briefs (version 1, built to be reverted cleanly)

Briefs are written here instead of a Google Doc: one per project, `projects/{id}.brief`. Asked for after
reviewing seven real Suits briefs (two first, then five more), via a mockup that went through four rounds:
"make it modular so suits can create the modules needed ... It looks like alot right now". Then: "build
version 1 first but I want to be able to revert cleanly if it is not for me."

- **Builder:** pick a template (Quick job, Video or social ads, Event, Campaign or series, Pitch, Blank).
  Each opens only its 4-6 essential sections and suggests the rest as highlighted chips. Any section can
  be added, moved or removed, and "Custom section" takes its own name. Section types live in
  `BRIEF_TYPES`, templates in `BRIEF_TEMPLATES`; adding one is one entry.
- **Card:** the job sentence, then the sections in the chosen order. The side column has key dates (with
  tracks, past ticked, NEXT on the upcoming one), dated updates (which replace sub-briefs), links, the
  budget link (Suits and admins only), and **gaps to chase**, worked out without AI: no job, nothing to
  make, no dates, steps with no date or person, "TBA/TBC" anywhere, speaker headshots still needed.
  "Closing report" is not chased for a date.
- **Key-date status on the card comes from the checklist**, not the calendar: a matching step (same name,
  any task in the project) that's ticked shows green, a past date whose step isn't ticked shows LATE in
  rose, a past date with no matching step is just grey. Shipped first as "past = green", which made an
  overdue step look done.
- **Dates into checklists: Suits and admins only, unticked by default** (`briefStepsAllowed()`). Asked: "should
  key dates placed in briefs flow into checklists? I don't want information to be duplicated or go stale".
  A two-way linked sync was proposed and declined as too complicated and too sticky to revert. It was then
  hidden entirely (everyone writes their own checklists), which raised "I'm also worried it may get lost
  or forgotten if we hide it". Settled on: visible to Suits only, off unless ticked, so nothing is
  duplicated by default; plus a Google Calendar reminder (about 6 Nov 2026) to review it with Suits and
  decide whether it becomes standard. `BRIEF_STEPS_ENABLED = false` hides it from everyone.
- **(Suits only, when ticked.) Key dates become checklist steps** on a chosen task in the project, matched by step name, so saving
  again updates the date and person instead of duplicating. Steps are never deleted. **If that task is
  open in the task window, the steps go into its checklist instead of the database**, so the task's own
  Save can't write the older list back over them.
- **Budget** is a link to a Sheet locked in Google Drive. The field and link only show for Suits members
  and admins; that hiding is tidiness, and the real lock is Drive sharing (departments are self-chosen,
  so the app can't enforce "Suits only"). Saving by a non-Suits person keeps the existing budget link.
- **Copy for partners** puts the brief on the clipboard as plain text, never including the budget.
- **After saving, the card shows the just-saved copy until the snapshot arrives** (`briefOpen.lastSaved`,
  newest by `updatedAt` wins), so it never falls back to an empty form.
- **Opened from:** "+ Brief" / "Brief" on the Projects card, the task window (Project field's helper
  line), and the WIP project header (only when a brief exists).
- **No AI, no cost, no setup:** no Google OAuth, no API key, no rules change (`projects` update only
  restricts `chat`).
- Verified end to end in Chromium against the real page with an in-memory Firestore stand-in that stores
  writes and re-fires snapshots (27 checks, plus the switched-off run).

**How to revert:**
1. **Switch it off:** set `BRIEFS_ENABLED = false` in the "CREATIVE BRIEFS" section of `index.html`, bump
   the build version as usual, and ship. Every button disappears and nothing else changes. Verified with
   the switch off: no buttons anywhere, no errors.
2. **Remove it entirely:** `git revert`, newest first, "Creative briefs: checklist option for Suits only",
   then "Creative briefs: dates stay in the brief for now",
   then "Creative briefs: key-date status from the checklist", then
   the commit titled "Creative briefs". It was shipped on its own
   on purpose: the section, three call sites each commented "see CREATIVE BRIEFS", one activity icon, the
   changelog entry and this note. Expect conflicts only in the build stamp and the changelog, as with the
   brief-links revert. Keep the changelog release object with `items: []` for read tracking.
- Either way, saved `brief` fields on projects can stay in Firestore harmlessly.

### Creative brief links: built and removed (2026-10-06)

A per-project "Creative Brief" button (`projects/{id}.briefUrl`, set via "+ Brief" on the Projects card, shown
on the card, in the task window and on the WIP header) shipped as its own commit, then was reverted the same
day: "It doesnt add much value and how I do it now is by adding it into checklist anyway." Brief links live
on **checklist items**, which already render them as a "Google Docs" link chip where the work is. **Don't
rebuild a project-level brief link.** Briefs themselves stay in Google Docs (rich content, comments, outside
partners, internal-only budgets). Any `briefUrl` values saved during that window are harmless leftovers.

### No mock/sample data

There is deliberately **no sample or demo content anywhere in this app.** A `seedDemoData()`
function and a "Load sample tasks" button (`#btn-load-sample`, shown in the empty-board banner) used
to inject 10 fictional tasks — and with them five invented teammates (Priya Nair, Marcus Lee, Ava
Chen, Diego Ruiz, Sam Osei) and five invented projects. Both are removed.

The problem wasn't the button, it was what it left behind: seeded tasks are indistinguishable from
real ones once created, and the invented names persisted into the assignee autocomplete and the
`@mention` roster (`uniqueValues('assignee')`), so they kept resurfacing as if they were colleagues.
The sibling Content Hub removed its equivalent seeding for exactly this reason — see "One-time
onboarding banner" in its `DESIGN.md`. **Don't re-add mock-content seeding.** If an onboarding aid is
wanted again, prefer something visibly marked as an example over real-looking documents.

The empty-board banner remains, now just saying the board is empty. The assignee field's placeholder
is a neutral instruction rather than a fake person's name, for the same reason.

Note this was a *code* removal — it can't delete tasks that button already created. If sample tasks
were ever loaded on the live board, those documents are still there and have to be deleted from the
board itself.

### State model

No framework/reactive layer — plain module-scoped `var`s (`tasks`, `currentView`,
`editingTaskId`, `activityLog`, `myNotifications`) mutated directly, with renderers called manually
after each mutation. `tasks` is fully replaced on every `onSnapshot` fire and is the single source
of truth for all views (no per-view derived state persisted).

### Firestore data model

Four top-level collections, all flat (see `firestore.rules` for the actual access boundary — the
client-side domain check in `isAllowedEmail` is UX only, not enforcement):

- **`tasks`** — one doc per *active* task, client-generated IDs (`uid()`, not Firestore auto-IDs).
  Fields: name, project, priority, status, start/deadline dates, assignee, `createdBy` (the
  creator's display name, stamped once at creation — see "Who can edit what (ownership rules)"
  below; absent on tasks saved before this field existed), Drive link, checklist, comments, time
  entries, plus a vestigial `dependsOn` (array of task ids — no editor, round-tripped only; see
  "Task dependencies were removed" above). Read/create are open to any `@mediashock.com.sg`
  account; `update`/`delete` are ownership-scoped — see "Who can edit what (ownership rules)"
  below for the current (update: creator-or-assignee-or-admin; delete: creator-or-admin, with a
  legacy assignee-based fallback) shape.
  - **Archived tasks live in a separate `archivedTasks` collection, not in `tasks` with a flag.**
    `tasksCol` is loaded via one unfiltered `onSnapshot` on every single session — every tab open,
    reload, or reconnect re-downloads the *entire* collection — and archiving used to just stamp
    `archivedAt` on the same doc rather than actually removing it, so that read cost only ever
    grew, forever, regardless of how much work was still actually active. `archiveTask`/
    `unarchiveTask`/`archiveCompletedTasks`/`archiveProjectTasks` now all move a task between the
    two collections (a `set` on the destination + a `delete` on the source in the same
    `writeBatch`, so it's atomic — never duplicated or lost, even if the batch fails partway).
    `archivedTasksCol` is loaded lazily (`ensureArchivedTasksListener`), only by the two views that
    actually read archived data (Projects, Archived) — Board/Gantt/Calendar/Focus/People never
    attach it, so most sessions never pay for it at all. Export and Import both force it to load
    first (`withArchivedTasksReady`) regardless of which views were opened this session, since
    both need the complete picture (an export missing archived history, or an import's
    "replace everything" delete leaving archived tasks behind, would both be silent data bugs).
    Reported directly ("how many users can PM accommodate to?" → Firestore's free-tier daily read
    quota, driven by `tasks` growing forever since nothing was ever removed from it).
    - **`migrateLegacyArchivedTasks`** is a one-time fix-it-forward migration (same pattern as the
      checklist-id and comment-threading backfills elsewhere in this file) for tasks archived
      before this split shipped — they still carry an `archivedAt` stamp but were never moved out
      of `tasks`. Whoever's session sees one of these in a `tasks` snapshot moves it, the same
      way `archiveTask` now does. No "already migrated" flag needed: once a doc is deleted from
      `tasksCol` it stops appearing in future snapshots, so this is self-limiting and safe to
      delete once nobody sees it fire in practice for a while.
    - Both collections use the exact same document shape and the same client-generated id, so a
      restore (`unarchiveTask`) is just the reverse move — the doc's Firestore id never changes
      across an archive/restore round-trip.
  - Each **checklist item** carries its own `uid()`-generated `id` (backfilled on load for older
    tasks saved before this existed — see the `.map()` over `task.checklist` in `openTaskModal`,
    same "fix it forward" pattern as `upsertUserDirectory` in the sibling Content Hub app), so a
    **time entry** can optionally reference one via `checklistItemId` — `null`/absent means
    "General," not tied to any item. There's no separate picker UI for this: the single
    `task-time-note` field doubles as both "what did you work on" and "which item," linked to a
    `task-time-checklist-suggestions` `<datalist>` of the checklist's item texts (same
    input-with-`<datalist>`-autocomplete pattern as the Assignee field) for discoverability.
    `checklistItemIdForNote(note)` resolves the link by exact case-insensitive text match against
    `currentChecklist` at commit time — so picking the suggestion (or typing an item's name
    verbatim) links it, but "Partial Content on 7 Aug, minus the CTA" doesn't, only the bare item
    text does. `checklistItemMinutes(itemId)` sums an item's linked entries for the small time
    badge on its checklist row; `renderChecklistItemSuggestions()` keeps the datalist's options in
    sync with the checklist and is called from the end of `renderChecklistEditor()` so the two
    never drift apart. Removing a checklist item does *not* touch time entries that referenced its
    id — they keep counting toward the task's totals, they just stop matching any item's badge.
- **`projects`** — one auto-ID doc per project, `{name, deadline}`, holding the project's **own**
  deadline, deliberately separate from the deadlines of the tasks inside it. The project name is a
  **field, not the doc ID**: project names are free text typed into the task modal, and one
  containing `/` is not a legal document ID. Looked up by name client-side (`projectDeadlineFor`)
  — one doc per project is a tiny collection, and this needs no composite index. `deadline` is an
  ISO date string or `null`.
  - **This resolved a real contradiction.** Before it existed, "project deadline" wasn't stored
    anywhere and was derived two incompatible ways at once: `renderProjects` sorted Ongoing by the
    *earliest* active task deadline, while `checkProjectDeadlinePopups` treated the *latest* task
    deadline as the project's due date. Both now read the stored deadline when one is set and fall
    back to their original derivation when it isn't, so undated projects behave exactly as before.
  - **With no deadline of its own, the card shows the one its tasks imply** — "Due <date>" from
    the latest open task deadline (same derivation as `checkProjectDeadlinePopups`), rose when
    past, violet within a day. Reported as "isn't the deadline set? why is it empty?" against a
    project whose tasks all had dates; "+ Deadline" now only shows when no open task has a date
    either. Clicking "Due …" still opens the field to set an explicit project deadline. The card's
    Group chat button was removed in the same pass, on request — chats live in the Chat tab.
  - **The card also shows a start date** ("Started 3 Sep" / "Starts 12 Oct"), derived, never
    stored: the earliest `startDate` across the project's tasks, archived ones included so the
    start doesn't drift later as early tasks are archived. It sits at the front of the deadline
    line (`rowOpen` in `projectCardHtml`) so the card reads as one date range instead of gaining
    a row; omitted when no task has a start date.
  - **Set in one place only — the Projects tab**, and progressively disclosed. A project with no
    deadline shows a quiet `+ Deadline` button (`.project-deadline-add`); the real
    `<input type="date">` (`.project-deadline-input`) is swapped in on click, or shown outright once a
    deadline exists. `projectDeadlineEditing` holds the one project name currently revealed.
    Abandoning the field without picking anything (`focusout` with an empty value) collapses it back,
    and clearing an existing deadline does too. All three handlers are delegated on `#projects-grid`,
    since `renderProjects` replaces its innerHTML on every snapshot.
    - **It used to be an always-visible date input on every card, and that was wrong.** The argument
      for it was "no hidden state to discover" — but it put an empty `mm/dd/yyyy` box on every
      undated project (9 of them on the real board), which reads as a form you're required to fill
      in, for a value most projects never set. That trade was defensible while the deadline was also
      drawn on the Timeline; once Timeline grouping was reverted the visible cost stayed and the
      payoff shrank, so it became clutter. Reported by the user as simply "why is the deadline there?".
    - Deliberately *not* also editable in the task modal: the same value settable from two places,
      where editing it inside one task silently moves it for every other task in the project, reads
      as a bug even though it isn't.
  - **Not shown on the Gantt.** Grouping the Gantt's rows by project (a project header row with a
    summary bar and a deadline tick) was built, shipped, and reverted the same day -- it didn't work
    in practice on the real board. `renderGantt` is back to a flat, start-date-ordered task list and
    is byte-identical to its pre-change version. The project deadline lives in the Projects tab only.
    Don't re-add Gantt grouping without asking first.
    - **Project identity and deadline pile-ups were later addressed without touching row order or
      grouping** (`projectColor`, `computeGanttDeadlineStacks`) — a comparison against TeamGantt
      found it doesn't group rows by project either (project color there is manual/optional, not
      automatic), which confirmed the flat list here isn't a compromise to fix later.
      - **`projectColor` and `PROJECT_BADGE_PALETTE` are gone (third design: no colour).** The
        project name in the Timeline and WIP timeline labels is now plain bold text. Asked
        directly what the colours meant, then agreed to remove them: 8 hashed hues across far
        more projects than that meant two rows matching did NOT mean the same project (three
        different projects showed in near-identical pink), and the pills competed with the bars'
        priority/status colours next to them. Colouring by `[Client]` was considered and rejected at
        the time — most projects are `[Google]`, so nearly every row would match. **Later asked for
        directly and built** ("highlight them in different colours and same text means same colour.
        These are client names"): `projectNameHtml(name)` tints only the `[Client]` part, never the
        row, on WIP (By project headers, agenda rows, WIP timeline labels) and the Timeline label.
        That fixes what was wrong before — same colour now really does mean same client. Colours
        are assigned by the order clients first appeared (earliest active-task `createdAt`), not by
        hashing, because a hash of ~6 clients into 10 hues almost always collides; client keys
        ignore case and spaces ("Little Paddington" = "LittlePaddington"). `CLIENT_PALETTE` avoids
        rose/amber/emerald/purple/orange, which already mean overdue/decision/done/review/brand.
        **Also in the toolbar's Projects filter dropdown** (asked for directly, 2026-10-06, with the menu widened to 36rem via `enhanceSelect's` new `opts.menuWidthClass`/`opts.optionHtml`; a wide menu near the right edge flips to right-align). **Also on Calendar v2** (item project lines). **Otherwise deliberately not on Board, Projects, Chat or Focus** — offered and declined
        (2026-10-05) in favour of trialling it on WIP first; widen only if the team asks. On the
        Board it would also sit next to the priority colours. Chat avatars keep their
        hashed colour (`PROJECT_AVATAR_PALETTE`): a filled circle needs some colour, and nobody
        reads meaning into it. History of the earlier two designs, kept for the reasoning:
      - `projectColor(t.project)` **also went through two designs.** The first gave each row a
        plain color bar/swatch next to the existing priority dot -- shipped, then reported back
        as "not immediately intuitive": two unlabeled colored marks sitting side by side with no
        way to tell which one meant what. Rebuilt so the color lives ON the project name itself,
        as a badge/pill (`PROJECT_BADGE_PALETTE`, the exact same soft `bg-*-100 text-*-700 ring-*`
        shape as `PRIORITY_META`/`DONE_META`/`READY_FOR_REVIEW_META`'s `.badge` classes, not a
        bare `bg-*-400` swatch) -- the color is now attached directly to the readable text it
        identifies instead of being a separate mark to memorize. Same name-hash trick as
        `avatarColor`, kept as its own palette so a project and a person never coincidentally
        share a color. Palette hues (orange/teal/indigo/fuchsia/cyan/lime/pink/violet)
        deliberately exclude rose/amber/sky/emerald/purple, since those already mean
        High/Medium/Low/Done/Ready-for-review elsewhere and a project landing on one of those by
        coincidence would read as a false status signal.
      - **The Gantt row's priority dot is gone** (the Board, People, Projects and Focus cards all
        still have theirs). It survived the `projectColor` rework above on the reasoning that a
        colored tag and a plain dot are two distinct signals rather than two competing swatches —
        true as far as it went, but it missed that this view *also* paints the same `pm` colour as
        a full-width bar a few hundred pixels to the right. Removed on request: "colors are
        already shown in the bars, so the dots are redundant and will only confuse." The reasoning
        is view-specific and does not transfer: the other views have no bar, which is precisely
        why they keep their dot.
      - `computeGanttDeadlineStacks(list)` **went through two designs.** The first flagged any
        two of one assignee's plotted (non-`Done`) tasks whose *date ranges* overlapped at all --
        shipped, then reported back as not actually useful: one person working across several
        projects' overlapping date ranges is completely normal, just a matter of them
        prioritizing what ships first, not a real conflict. What's actually worth a warning is
        two or more of one person's tasks sharing the exact same **deadline** -- everything
        landing due the same day with no slack to sequence it. Rebuilt around that instead (same
        function name's intent, `s/computeGanttConflicts/computeGanttDeadlineStacks/` and every
        call site), grouping by `t.deadline` (already a plain `YYYY-MM-DD` string from the
        `<input type="date">` field, so no timezone-conversion helper needed) within each
        assignee, not by interval overlap. Surfaced identically to how the first version was --
        an amber `!` badge on the bar's top-left corner (top-right is already the overdue dot;
        different corner and shape so the two warnings don't blur into each other), a
        `#gantt-stack-note` count next to the existing `#gantt-hidden-note`, and the specific
        stacked task name(s) named in the bar's tooltip -- only the trigger condition changed.
      - TeamGantt's closest equivalent (a Workloads heat-map showing hours/day per person) lives
        in a separate report, not on the chart itself, and its own users have publicly asked for
        an on-chart version that doesn't exist yet -- this is that, tuned to what this team
        actually finds worth a warning rather than a straight port of TeamGantt's own metric.
- **`people`** — the **team roster**: one doc per teammate, **doc ID = their Firebase uid**,
  `{name, email, photoURL, lastSeen}`, upserted by `registerPresence(user)` on every sign-in
  (`onAuthStateChanged`, deliberately *before* `startListeners` so a first-time signer-in is
  already in their own session's snapshot and can assign themselves a task without reloading).
  - **Profile photos are pulled from the person's Google account (`user.photoURL`), not an
    upload feature.** Requested directly ("insert a profile image"); the choice between
    auto-pulling Google's photo vs. building a real upload flow (Firebase Storage, a new
    `storage.rules` file with its own deploy step, upload/crop UI) was put to the user rather
    than assumed — Google's photo won as the zero-infrastructure option, with real upload noted
    as a possible later layer on top if anyone actually wants to override it. `null`, not `''`,
    for "no photo" — `avatarHtml()`'s truthiness check would otherwise render a broken
    `<img src="">` for every account with none set.
    - **`avatarHtml(name, className, textSizeClass)`** is the one shared renderer for every small
      avatar circle in the app (comments, time entries, mentions, Focus of the Day, Board rows,
      People cards, suggestions, archived rows) — a real `<img>` when `personPhotoUrl(name)` finds
      one, the pre-existing colored-initials `<span>` (`avatarColor`/`initials`) otherwise. Matched
      by **display name** against `teamPeople`, same as every other name-based lookup in this file
      — most call sites only ever have a name string (`t.assignee`, `comment.author`, ...), never
      a uid. `className` carries whatever sizing/spacing the call site needs; the function only
      appends what differs between the photo and initials cases.
    - Google photo URLs get `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` on the `<img>` — a known quirk where
      Google can 403 the request when it carries this page's own URL as a referrer, unrelated to
      anything specific to this app.
    - **The sidebar's own user-chip avatar reads `user.photoURL` directly, not through
      `avatarHtml()`/`personPhotoUrl()`.** It's set from `onAuthStateChanged`, which can fire
      before this session's own `people` snapshot has arrived with the value `registerPresence`
      (called right after, in the same handler) is about to write — looking it up via the roster
      at that exact moment could race and miss it. `user.photoURL` is the identical value,
      available immediately with no snapshot dependency.
  - **Why it exists.** Before it, the only answer to "who is on this team" was inferred from the
    board itself (`uniqueValues('assignee')`), so a new joiner did not exist to the app until
    someone hand-typed their name onto a task — they could not be picked, and could not be
    `@mentioned`. Worse, typing that name slightly wrong created a second, permanent person who
    could never receive a notification: `notifications.recipient` is a display name matched in
    `firestore.rules` against `request.auth.token.name`, so a near-miss is written successfully
    and then read by nobody. Silent, with no error on either side. This became urgent at ~11
    people; it never bit at 5, where everyone knew everyone's exact display name.
  - **`teamRoster()`** is the accessor — roster names UNION every name already on a task. The
    task half is *not* legacy cruft: tasks created before this collection existed carry names
    with no uid behind them, and dropping them would silently reassign the task the next time
    anyone opened it. `parseMentions`, `enrichCommentText`, the mention autocomplete and the
    assignee picker all read this; `renderPeople` and the assignee *filter* deliberately still
    read `uniqueValues('assignee')`, since those answer "who currently has work," not "who exists."
  - **Rules are narrower than every other collection here**: read by the whole team, but
    `create/update` only where `personId == request.auth.uid`, and `delete: if false`. This is
    the one collection where shared write would be actively harmful — rewriting someone else's
    `name` silently redirects their notifications. A leaver is handled by not signing in, not by
    deleting a row their old tasks still reference by name.
  - The module-level list is `teamPeople`, **not** `people` — `renderPeople()` declares its own
    local `people` meaning something different (who currently has tasks), and the shadowing was
    a trap waiting for the next edit.
- **`activity` rows open what they're about.** `logActivity(type, summary, target)` stores an
  optional `taskId` or `chatProject` (task created/updated/moved/commented/archived/restored, chat
  created). Rows with one are clickable (`openActivityTarget`, hover border + chevron): an active
  task opens its task window; an archived one switches to Archived searched to its name (archived
  tasks aren't edited in the task window); a since-deleted one gives a toast. Entries written
  before this have no target and stay plain — matching by the name in the summary was rejected,
  since task names repeat across projects and a wrong guess is worse than no link. Deleted-task,
  leave, department, deadline and import entries deliberately carry no target. No rules change:
  `activity` create has no field restrictions.
- **`activity`** — append-only log (`logActivity`), queried as latest **200** by `at desc`, and
  searchable from the main search box (see below). Was 50, which is several days of history at
  five people and about an afternoon at eleven — quietly turning an audit trail into a "recently"
  list. Raised and made searchable in the same pass: a longer feed is only useful if you can find
  anything in it.
- **`notifications`** — per-recipient; unlike the other two collections this one *does* restrict
  read/update/delete to the addressed recipient (matched against `request.auth.token.name` or
  `.email`, since `recipient` is stored as a display name — see comments in `firestore.rules`).
  Queried with `where("recipient", "==", ...)` only, sorted client-side — deliberately no
  `orderBy` alongside the `where`, to avoid needing a composite index for a query this simple.
- **`suggestions`** — one doc per suggestion, with replies as an embedded array
  (`{text, author, date}` objects, updated via full-array-rewrite on `updateDoc`) rather than a
  subcollection. Shared read/write like `tasks`, with two carve-outs: a doc can only be *created*
  with `source: 'ai'` by an admin, and its `status` field (Open/WIP/Fixed — every suggestion, not
  just AI ones) can only be *changed* by an admin — see "AI Product Insights (Suggestions tab)"
  below for both. **Moving a suggestion INTO Fixed notifies its author** (`notifySuggestionFixed`,
  notification `type: 'suggestion_fixed'`, carries `suggestionId`; clicking it opens the
  Suggestions view). Not sent for AI-imported suggestions, nor when the admin is the author, nor
  when it was already Fixed. "Unable to Fix" deliberately sends nothing — only Fixed was asked for.
  The author is matched by stored display name, same as every other notification.
- **`aiSuggestionImports`** — one doc per imported GitHub issue number, dedup bookkeeping for the
  AI Product Insights import flow (below). Same shape as `notificationDedup`, but write is
  admin-only rather than whole-team, since only an admin can trigger an import at all.
- **`projectTyping`** — ephemeral "who's typing" presence for a project's group chat (see
  "Project group chat" above), one doc per project sharing that project's own `projects/{id}`
  doc id: `{entries: [{name, at}]}`. Whole-team read/write, same as `projects`. Not queried with
  `where`/`orderBy`, so it needs no index entry.

Any *new* top-level collection needs both a `firestore.rules` block and, if it's ever queried with
`where` + `orderBy` together, an entry in `firestore.indexes.json` — and neither deploys with the
site. Pushing to `main` only updates the static GitHub Pages site; rules/indexes require a separate
`firebase deploy` (or pasting the rules into the Firebase Console) as a one-time manual step per
change, or every read/write against the new collection fails with "Missing or insufficient
permissions" even though the code and the deployed page are otherwise correct.

### Popups that open over the sidebar (`.panel-raised`)

Every floating panel in this app is `bg-white dark:bg-zinc-800`. That is fine over `<main>`, but
it is **the sidebar's own colour** — so the two panels that open over the rail (the user/profile
menu and the teamspace switcher) shared its surface exactly and read as part of it rather than as
something above it. Reported directly, from a screenshot of the profile menu.

- **Two cues, because one is not enough here.** A shadow deeper than `shadow-pop`, plus — in dark
  mode only — a surface one step **lighter** than the rail (`dark:bg-zinc-700` against the
  sidebar's `zinc-800`). Lighter-means-higher is the usual dark-UI elevation convention; going
  *darker* instead reads as a hole cut into the sidebar rather than a panel on top of it.
- **Light mode keeps white** and leans on the shadow plus a firmer border (`zinc-300`, not
  `zinc-200`). Panel and rail are both `rgb(255,255,255)` there and that is fine — white-on-white
  separated by a shadow and a hairline is the standard popover treatment.
- **Deliberately scoped to those two panels.** Everything else (notification, digest, filter and
  chat menus) opens over `<main>`, which is already a different colour, so widening this would be
  a restyle nobody asked for.
- **Everything inside these two panels had to move a step with the surface** — dividers
  (`dark:border-zinc-600`) and hover states (`dark:hover:bg-zinc-600`). They were tuned against
  `zinc-800` and are invisible against `zinc-700`.
  - **The teamspace options were missed on the first pass and shipped broken** — "why doesn't it
    highlight when I hover". Their hover was `dark:hover:bg-zinc-700/60`, i.e. the panel's own
    new colour tinted over itself. The markup hovers in the profile menu were updated at the
    time; these were missed **because they are built in JS**, so a grep over the markup did not
    surface them.
  - **Rule for anything added to `#teamspace-menu` or `#user-menu-panel`: its hover/border must
    clear `zinc-700`, not sit on it.** Verified by reading rendered values rather than trusting
    class names — hover `rgb(82,82,91)` against panel `rgb(63,63,70)`.
- Verified by reading the rendered values rather than eyeballing: panel `rgb(63,63,70)` vs rail
  `rgb(39,39,42)` in dark with a real box-shadow, plus a screenshot of each theme.

### People card header: identity vs workload

The header is **two lines**: name + identity chips (departments, "Admin rights") on the first,
workload on the second ("N active", Away, overdue, high).

**The header sits on its own tinted band** (`bg-zinc-100` / `dark:bg-zinc-700/60`, name in
`zinc-900`/white), the same treatment as the Board's project cards, so the person reads as a
step above their task rows. On that band the grey "N high" chip is white / `zinc-800` (a
`zinc-100` chip would vanish into it), and the big count and "N active" text moved one shade
darker to stay legible.

They used to share one row — `2 active | Production | Admin | 1 high` — and it was reported as
messy. It was, for a reason worth keeping written down:

- **Two different kinds of fact at equal weight, interleaved.** Departments say *who someone is*;
  the counts say *how loaded they are*. Split by each other, neither could be scanned.
- **Department chips vary in width**, so the workload numbers started at a different x on every
  card. On a view whose entire job is comparing workload across people, the one thing that should
  line up didn't.
- **The departments were the most colourful thing in the row**, so identity pulled the eye first
  on a card that is about capacity.

**Same problem and same fix as the Board card's metadata row** (reported as cluttered, split into
explicit rows): the grouping becomes structural instead of depending on how wide the content
happens to be.

- **The identity row wraps (`flex-wrap`) rather than truncating the name.** A render with three
  chips cut "Deane Cheng" down to "Deane Ch…" — the name is the card's primary identifier, so
  chips drop to a second line instead.
- **The admin ROLE chip reads "Admin rights", not "Admin".** Once Admin existed as a *department*
  too, a person who was both got two chips saying the same word in different colours. The role is
  about `firestore.rules`, the department is about which team they work on; the label now says
  which one it is.

### Teamspaces (departments)

Notion-style teamspaces — Suits, Production, Marketing, Admin. Pick one in the sidebar switcher
and the whole app scopes to it.

**A task belongs to the teamspace of whoever it is assigned to.** That is the entire scoping
rule, and it is the *second* rule this feature had.

- **It first scoped by the PROJECT's own hand-filed departments, and that was abandoned within a
  day.** The user named the flaw exactly: *"but every project will involve Suits & Production.
  How do I solve this?"* Project-level teamspaces only work when a project belongs to one team —
  Notion's do, because a teamspace there holds documents one team owns. These projects are client
  engagements every department touches, so every project ended up filed under every department,
  every teamspace showed everything, and the only thing the feature reliably produced was filing
  work. **Don't reintroduce per-project filing.**
- **What actually divides the work is the task.** Inside one Lark project the video edit is
  Production's, the client deck is Suits', the socials are Marketing's, the invoice is Admin's.
  Scoping by the assignee's department splits it along exactly that line: **one project appears
  in several teamspaces while showing different tasks in each**, which is what was wanted.
- **This is why a person's department is no longer "a second axis".** The original objection to
  using it was that two sources of truth would disagree; there is now only one, because the
  project has no opinion at all.
- **`projectDepartments(name)` is DERIVED, never stored** — computed from the project's
  assignees, for the Projects/Chat lists and the read-only chips on a project card. Nothing to
  maintain, and it cannot drift the way a manual field does the moment someone is reassigned.
  - **It counts "Also involved" people, not just owners.** Reported: a project a Suits member was
    involved in vanished from Suits once someone from another team became the owner. A project is
    a team's business if anyone on that team works on it. **Task-level too, since a follow-up
    report** ("SMB Q4 isn't under Suits because Calcium is the owner", on the Board):
    `taskInTeamspace` uses the same people via `taskTeamspacePeople` (owner + involved +
    checklist-item assignees), so a task shows on the Board/Timeline/Calendar/Focus/WIP of every
    teamspace someone on it belongs to. It was owner-only at first, which let a project show under
    Suits with none of its tasks on the Suits Board. Workload counts stay per person and
    owner-only; the People view under a teamspace may now list an owner from another team, which
    it already did for "whoever is working on its projects". A handoff now keeps the old owner as involved (see
    "Also involved"), but tasks handed off *before* that change may have dropped them — adding
    them back under `+ Also involved` restores the project to their teamspace.
  Old `projects` docs may still carry a `departments` array from the filed-by-hand version; it is
  **deliberately ignored rather than migrated**, since reading it would restore the second,
  conflicting source of truth this change removed. Harmless to leave in Firestore.
- **Removed with the old design**: the `+ Teamspace` button and its checkboxes,
  `setProjectDepartments`, `ensureProjectDoc`, `parkMyProjectsInDepartment` (the auto-filing that
  ran when someone picked a department), `projectsForPerson`, and `projectDeptEditing`. Setting a
  department now re-sorts that person's work on its own — there is nothing left to file. Net
  result is **less** UI and state than the first version: one field per person, nothing per
  project.
- **`people/{uid}.departments`** is the one input: an **array**, set from the People card
  (self-or-admin, via the existing `canEditLeaveFor` gate) or from the first-login modal.
  - **It started as a single `department` string and was widened on request** — "can we allow
    people to choose more than one department as their roles may change or be added on." The
    original single-value argument (one home team, an unambiguous landing teamspace) did not
    survive contact with people who genuinely hold two roles.
  - **`personDepartments()` reads BOTH shapes**: the array, falling back to the old single
    string. Nothing was migrated — the fallback is one line, and a real migration would have to
    run through each teammate's own signed-in session anyway, since this app has no admin
    credential (same gap the checklist-threading backfill documents). Writes always use the
    array; the old field is left in place and simply stops being consulted.
  - **Checkboxes, not `<select multiple>`** — the native control is genuinely hard to use
    (ctrl-click to add, and clicking a second option silently replaces the first).
  - **Edited in the user/profile menu (`#profile-dept-options`), NOT on the People card.** The
    card version put a permanently-open row of checkboxes on every single person and was reported
    as clutter — correctly: it is a set-once preference about yourself, which is what that menu
    is for. **The read-only chips stay on the card**, so who is on which team is still visible at
    a glance; only the editing moved.
  - **Consequence, accepted**: an admin can no longer set *somebody else's* departments. The old
    People-card control allowed it, but nobody asked for it and it was only reachable through the
    clutter that got removed. If it is ever wanted, the honest place is an admin-only control,
    not a row on every card.
  - **Landing teamspace: exactly one department → that one; several → All.** The array is in
    `DEPARTMENTS` order rather than preference order, so picking one of several would be
    arbitrary *and* would hide the rest of their own work on arrival. Same rule in both
    `applyDefaultTeamspaceOnce()` and the first-login modal.
- **Unassigned is a catch-all, not a department.** It holds work whose assignee has no
  department — hasn't picked, answered "Not now", or is a hand-typed assignee name with no roster
  row at all. It is meant to drain as people pick, and a non-empty Unassigned is the signal that
  somebody still needs to choose.
- **The self path is keyed by UID, never by display name.** Departments are only ever edited for
  yourself, so the name lookup the first version used was an indirection on the one path where
  the document id is already known — and it is the only plausible way a saved choice fails to
  stick (a display name that no longer matches the stored `name`, or two roster rows sharing one
  name, so the write lands on a different row than the check reads). `myDepartments()` /
  `setMyDepartments()` both go through `myPersonDoc()`, which **already existed** for the chat
  favourites and is reused rather than duplicated. (It *was* duplicated on the first attempt;
  `scripts/check-syntax` caught the redeclaration before it shipped — exactly what that check is
  for.) `setDoc(…, {merge:true})` rather than `updateDoc`, so a roster row that somehow doesn't
  exist yet is created instead of the write failing.
- **A `localStorage` mirror (`flowboard_dept_prompted`) stops the modal reappearing after a
  deploy.** Reported directly: "have the tool remember the choices here so that it does not
  repeat after each update." The Firestore flag is still the real record — it follows you to
  another machine — but it is read from a snapshot that may not have arrived yet, and the
  auto-reload after a deploy lands in exactly that window. The local flag is checked **first**,
  without touching the roster at all, and is also set when the Firestore flag is seen, so a
  device that learns the answer from the server stops asking too.
- **First-login prompt** (`#department-modal`): its own modal rather than an `openConfirm`, which
  only holds two choices. **Multi-select with a Continue button**, not one-tap-and-close, since
  people hold more than one role and roles get added over time. **`departmentChosen` is a separate flag from `department`** — gating on
  `department` being empty would re-ask, every visit, anyone who deliberately answered "no
  department". "Not now" sets it too, so this is a one-time question rather than a nag.
  `maybePromptDepartment()` defers while any modal is open, the same courtesy
  `checkProjectDeadlinePopups` extends.
- **`applyDefaultTeamspaceOnce()`** lands someone in their own department the first time, unless
  they have already chosen a teamspace themselves (*including* choosing All). Runs from the
  `people` snapshot handler, not `loadTeamspace()`, because the answer lives in `teamPeople`,
  which is empty at module load.
- **Not part of `filters`.** A teamspace is *where you are*, not a chip narrowing what you see in
  it: own switcher, own `localStorage` key (`flowboard_teamspace`), and **"Clear filters" does
  not reset it**.
- **Focus of the Day IS teamspace-scoped** while still ignoring the toolbar filters — the strip
  has to live in the workspace you are standing in. **Activity and Suggestions are not scoped**:
  an activity row is not reliably attributable to an assignee, and suggestions are about the tool
  rather than the work.
- **`renderPeople` unions "people with work here" with "people who belong here"** — it was
  task-derived only, so a teammate with no current tasks never appeared, including a new joiner,
  who is exactly the person you want to hand a department to. The roster half is skipped while
  search/priority/project is narrowing, or a roster member with no matching tasks would show up
  anyway and read as the search being broken.
- **Adding *or removing* a department is one `DEPARTMENTS` entry plus one `DEPARTMENT_BADGE`
  colour** — the switcher, its counts, the profile menu, the first-login modal and the derived
  project chips all read from those two places. Marketing was added exactly that way, and removed
  again the same way a few minutes later.
  - **Removing needs no data migration.** `personDepartments()` filters stored values against the
    live list, so a key that is no longer there is ignored wherever it is read — the same
    unknown-key handling that was already tested. Verified against stored values on removal:
    `["production","marketing"]` reads as `["production"]`, and `["marketing"]` reads as `[]`.
  - **The one visible consequence**: anyone whose *only* department was the removed one now
    counts as having none, so their tasks move to Unassigned until they pick again from the
    profile menu. Worth saying out loud when a department is retired.
  - **Stale values are deliberately left in Firestore.** A person's row is writable only by
    themselves or an admin, so there is no safe way to rewrite everyone's — and since reading
    already ignores them, cleaning up would buy nothing.
- **No `firestore.rules` change at any point.** `department`/`departmentChosen` are fields on the
  person's own `people/{uid}` doc, which is already scoped to self-or-admin.
- **Known trade, accepted**: a task assigned to someone with no department falls into Unassigned,
  so the departments only become useful once people have picked — which is the first-login
  prompt's job. And a Production person picking up an admin task counts as Production; the person
  is the unit, not the work type.
- Verified with an isolated Node port of the scoping rules: one shared project yields four
  different task lists across four teamspaces, archived work counts toward a project's derived
  chips, unknown department keys contribute nothing, and a no-department assignee lands in
  Unassigned.

### Personal leave (time off)

Leave is stored **on the person's roster doc** — `people/{uid}.leave`, an array of
`{id, start, end, note}` with both ends inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD` strings — **not on a task, and
emphatically not as a task status.** That was the first instinct and it's wrong: one person going
away affects every task they hold at once, and it says nothing about how any of that work is
progressing, so as a status it would have to be set *and unset* on each of their tasks by hand
while corrupting the field `dueUrgency`, `focusScore`, `isReadyForReview` and the Done count all
read.

**Researched against TeamGantt and Monday before building.** Neither reschedules anything around
leave, which is why this doesn't either:
- **TeamGantt** has company-wide holidays only. For individual time off its own documentation
  recommends *"create a task called Vacation and assign yourself to it"* — the workaround above,
  which is exactly what we avoided. Its Workloads heat map has no concept of a person being away.
- **Monday** does log real per-person PTO (a Schedules page, separate from holiday schemes) and
  subtracts it from capacity — but it feeds the **Workload widget**, not the timeline bars, and
  it's Pro/Enterprise only.

So leave here is a **visibility signal**: it shades the days and names the clash, and a human
decides what to move.

- **`leaveFor` / `isOnLeave` / `leavePeriodOn`** compare raw `YYYY-MM-DD` strings — no `Date`
  parsing and no timezone helper, because the format sorts lexicographically. Same reasoning as
  `computeGanttDeadlineStacks` grouping on the raw `t.deadline` string.
- **The Gantt warns on a DEADLINE landing inside leave, not on date-range overlap** —
  `#gantt-leave-note`, alongside the existing hidden/stack notes. This is the same lesson
  `computeGanttDeadlineStacks` learned by shipping the wrong version first: a task merely
  *spanning* someone's time off is normal, they work either side of it. A deadline landing while
  they're away can't resolve itself.
- **The band is a diagonal hatch (`.gantt-leave`), not a flat tint.** The day columns already use
  flat tints for weekend and for today; a third flat colour reads as a fourth kind of *day*
  rather than as "this one person is away". Emitted before the bar in the same relative container
  so DOM order puts it underneath, with `pointer-events: none` so it can't eat a click meant for
  the bar. Deliberately **no third badge on the bar** — the top-right overdue dot and top-left
  amber stack badge already carry two warnings, and CLAUDE.md's own note on that pair says a
  third would blur them.
- **Entry is in the People tab**, progressively disclosed behind a quiet `+ Time off` button
  (`leaveEditingFor`) — same pattern and same reasoning as the Projects tab's deadline field: an
  always-visible pair of empty date boxes on every person card reads as a form you must fill in,
  for a value most people don't have set at any moment. Handlers are delegated on `#people-grid`
  since `renderPeople` replaces its innerHTML.
  - **`+ Time off` sits top-right of a "Time off" header row, not stacked below "None booked."**
    — the original layout stacked label / status / button in one column, which read as the
    button being an afterthought rather than an action tied to the heading above it (reported
    directly against a screenshot). `personLeaveSectionHtml` now builds a `toggleBtn` (header row,
    right-aligned via `flex justify-between`) separately from the full add-period `editorForm`
    (start/end/note/Add/Cancel), which still renders below the status content once
    `leaveEditingFor === name` — four inputs plus two buttons don't fit next to a label without
    wrapping badly, so only the toggle moved, not the whole editor.
  - **`toggleBtn` is a real bordered pill, not plain colored text** — same shape as the Archived
    view's `Restore` button (`border` + `hover:bg-zinc-50`, not just a hover text-color change).
    It started as quiet colored text matching `.project-deadline-add`'s style (the Projects tab's
    own progressive-disclosure button, which stays that way — this change was scoped to Time off
    only, not applied everywhere that pattern appears) and was reported back as not reading as
    interactive at all. `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed` covers the
    not-signed-in-yet disabled state, matching the same utility pair already used on
    `#task-deadline`.
- **`canEditLeaveFor`** mirrors the `people` rule — yourself, or an admin. `ADMIN_EMAILS` in
  index.html is **UI gating only, not the boundary**; keep it identical to `admins()` in
  `firestore.rules`.
- **The rules needed no change** — `people` already allowed the owner or an admin to write the
  whole doc, and `leave` is just another field on it.
- **Known limits**: (1) someone who has never signed in has no roster doc, so there's nowhere to
  attach their leave — the `+ Time off` button is disabled with a title saying so; (2) the People
  tab only lists people with tasks matching the current filters, so you can't book leave for
  someone with no active work; (3) the roster listener now calls `renderAll()`, so another
  person signing in mid-edit will clear the date inputs you were typing into.
- `logActivity` fires **inside `saveLeave`'s success path**, not at the call site, so a rules
  denial or dropped connection can't log something that never happened. Its own
  `leave_changed` activity type, amber, matching the Away chip and the Gantt note — one colour
  for "someone is not available" everywhere it appears.

### Events → WIP Meeting (the standing company sync)

A labelled **Events** category in the sidebar rail, holding one view: **WIP Meeting**. One
screen the whole company reads together, built as a meeting **agenda** rather than another
dashboard — what has to be decided today, then what is coming, then who will not be here for it.

**Nothing in it is new data.** Every number comes from the helpers the board and the
notification automations already use: `dueUrgency`, `isOnLeave`/`leavePeriodOn`, the
"≥2 open High-priority tasks on one person for one day" rule `checkWorkloadSpikes` notifies on,
and `REVIEW_STALE_DAYS`. This is the whole reason it is safe to add — a summary that computes
"overdue" its own way eventually disagrees with the board it is summarising, in front of
everyone. If you change a threshold, change it in the one place and this follows.

**Two modes: By project (default) and Agenda.** Suits runs the meeting project by project — open a
project, talk through its deliverables and deadlines, move on — replacing their "Internal Content
Project Brief" sheet. So WIP opens on **By project** (`wipProjectsHtml`) for everyone, every time;
`wipMode` is deliberately **not** persisted, on request ("WIP view should be the same for
everyone"). Each project (open work in the teamspace, ordered by soonest open deadline, undated
last) lists its open tasks by deadline with owner, status and due/overdue, and under each task its
open checklist steps (the sheet's "Next steps") with owner and date, capped at `WIP_STEPS_SHOWN` (3)
with "+N more". Projects **start collapsed** to their title line (`wipProjectOpen` holds the ones opened, session-only; asked for directly -- they used to start open). A project also shows open while something on it is being edited or its Contact & links panel is open, so a ⋯-row action never happens invisibly inside a fold. **A folded header must not look calmer than it is**: it shows "N overdue" (rose, `dueUrgency`) and "N behind" (amber, the Behind alert's late-checklist-step rule), and takes the live-change flash for any task inside it. Done tasks are
hidden. **Needs a decision stays on top in both modes, but in By project it is shrunk to one line**
("4 items need a decision · Overdue 2 · Behind 1 …", amber; the same row opens and closes it, the list hanging under it in one card -- it used to become a section header with a small "Hide" at the far right, reported as the wrong place to close it;
`wipAlertsOpen`, session-only). Chosen over leaving it in full (it duplicated items the project
walkthrough covers anyway and pushed the projects down) and over moving it to the bottom (easy to
skip; crunch and leave-clash items appear nowhere else). Agenda mode keeps the full list, since
there it is the first agenda item. The day list, Away and the timeline are the **Agenda** mode.
**Away is in By project too** (asked for directly): the same Away card as Agenda (`wipAwayHtml`)
in a narrow right column (`#wip-projects-wrap` grid, `#wip-away-side`, 19rem, sticky) beside the
projects. It first shipped as a one-line strip above the projects and was replaced minutes later
from a wide-screen screenshot ("can this width be reduced to make way for the Leaves window?") —
the project rows were leaving most of their width empty. **Two columns only from 1400px**
(`min-[1400px]:`, Tailwind CDN 3.4 arbitrary variant): below that the task rows' fixed columns
(owner/status/due/+Status ≈ 28rem) would squeeze task names, so the card stacks under the
projects. It reads the 1/2/4-week window, otherwise unused in By project. Both views share
`wipAwayRows`. **24rem, not 19rem, and the dates/note line wraps instead of truncating**: at
19rem the "Away now" badge squeezed the first row's note to "Hos…" (reported from a screenshot,
"there is enough space"). The wider column fixes the common case; wrapping guarantees a long
note is never cut off.

**Status per task, client contact and key links** (from the Suits "WIP Tracker" sheet's Status /
Client contact / Key links columns).
- **Status is on each TASK** (`tasks/{id}.statusUpdates` [{id, date, text, author, at,
  editedBy?}], data functions under TASK STATUS), because the sheet has one status per
  deliverable row. **It first shipped on the project** (`projects/{id}.updates`, one strip under
  the header) and was reported back the same day: "Status should be in each task. Not like this".
  The project-level UI and its add/edit/remove functions are gone; any `updates` already written
  to a project doc are left in Firestore and no longer shown.
  - A task with a status shows its latest line in a tinted band (brand tint + 3px brand left edge
    — the contrast asked for after the first version blended into the rows), older lines behind
    "Show N earlier" (`WIP_UPDATES_SHOWN` = 1), "+ Update" for a newer line. **Clicking the text
    edits it** (no hover-only pencil: WIP runs on a shared screen).
  - A task with none shows a small grey speech-bubble-with-plus icon (`wipAddStatusIconHtml`, `ICONS.messagePlus`, tooltip "Add status"; a bare "+" was reported as not intuitive) at
    the end of its line, in a fixed `w-6` slot kept even when empty so the due-date column stays
    aligned. It was the words "+ Status" on every row and was reported as messy — a column of
    identical words is the loudest thing on screen for what is only an empty slot. Text
    deliverables use the same icon. The task line is a `div` holding the open-task button plus
    that slot, since buttons can't nest.
  - **Logged to Activity** as `task_updated` with the task as target — task edits are meant to be
    recorded there ("anyone can edit the whole task but it still gets recorded in activity").
    Doesn't touch `updatedAt`, so a status note doesn't reset the stale-review clock.
  - Safe against the task modal: `commitTaskSave` writes with `setDoc(..., {merge: true})`, so it
    never wipes `statusUpdates`. Import carries it (`sanitizeImportedStatusUpdates`).
  - No rules change: task `update` is open to the whole team.
- **Client contact and links** stay on the project's own `projects/{id}` doc: `clientContact` and
  `links` — **the same array as the project chat's Pinned links**, so a link added in either place
  shows in both. Because of that, `createProjectChat` no longer resets `links` when it already
  exists, and `deleteProjectChat` removes messages only, not links. **They open from "Contact & links"
  in the project's ⋯ row**, on request ("no need to be shown at this level, just accessible to
  Suits"), as a panel under the header (`wipProjectDetailsHtml`, `wipDetailsOpen`, session-only).
  The title bar itself shows only a small link icon + count, and only when something is saved — it
  was the words "Contact & links" on every project and was reported as messy. Both only render for Suits members and admins
  (`wipCanSeeDetails`: `myDepartments()` includes `suits`, or `isAdminUser()`). **Display only,
  not a boundary** — the fields are on the team-readable project doc, and the links are also the
  chat's Pinned links, visible to anyone who opens that chat. Not logged to Activity.
- Decisions made with the user: **anyone on the team can add, edit or remove**; **money columns
  (cost SGD/USD, PO, quotation, invoice) stay in the sheet** — add the sheet as a key link; **Lost
  Jobs stay in the sheet**. One inline editor at a time (`wipEdit`; for a task status its
  `project` holds the task id), drafts in `wipDraft` and focus restored after each live re-render
  so someone else's save doesn't wipe what you're typing. Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- **Projects are grouped by WIP category**, in Suits' order (labels in sentence case, like every in-page label): Active jobs, Content marketing,
  Pitches, Hot leads, Cold leads, Closing reports (`WIP_CATEGORIES`), then **Not sorted** for
  anything uncategorised, so nothing vanishes. Empty groups are skipped; within a group, soonest
  open deadline first. Stored as `projects/{id}.wipCategory` (absent or an unknown key = Not
  sorted, so a category can be renamed/retired without migrating). Set from the project header in
  WIP: "Set category" (brand) until set; after that a small always-visible ⋯ icon
  (`ICONS.moreHorizontal`). Both open one row under the header: category pills plus "+ Notes".
  Third design: a visible "Category" on every row was reported as noise; the hover-only "Change
  category"/"+ Notes" that replaced it was reported as hidden ("some items are hidden until
  hovered") — and `opacity-0` still reserved their width, leaving an empty gap on every header.
  **Don't put anything hover-only on these headers again.** It opens a pill row under the header
  (`wipCategoryPicking`, kept in state so a live re-render doesn't close it — a native `<select>`
  would snap shut on every roster heartbeat). Anyone can change it (same as status); logged to
  Activity as `project_category`. No rules change.
  - Decided with the user: **set by hand in WIP, anyone can change it**; **Content marketing sits
    second as listed** — this replaced a name-matched "Mediashock LinkedIn always last" rule
    shipped an hour earlier. "A lead needs at least one open task to appear" was the first
    answer, and was reversed the same day once the sheet's Cold leads (a client + one line, no
    tasks, no Drive folder) and Pending closing reports (all work done) were shown — see below.
- **A categorised project stays on WIP with no open tasks** (`wipProjectsHtml` adds every
  `projectDocs` entry with a valid `wipCategory`), which is what keeps Closing reports populated
  after the work is done. **Setting Not sorted is how anything leaves WIP.**
- **"+ Add entry"** (section header) adds a WIP-only entry: name, one-line note, category pills
  (`wipAddEntryHtml`, `addWipEntry`). It is just a `projects` doc with `wipCategory` + `wipNote`
  and no tasks; a name matching an existing project only categorises that project. **It never
  reaches Board/Timeline/Projects/Chat**, because those list projects from tasks
  (`allProjectNames`), and the WIP alerts/agenda only read `projectDocs` with a deadline AND
  tasks. Logged to Activity. When a lead becomes a job, create the real project as usual and set
  the lead entry to Not sorted.
- **The sheet's row shape, for entries without tasks** (asked for: "these entries may not have a
  deadline or owner yet if it's a hot or cold lead. I will also need status, next steps, notes").
  Sheet = one row per deliverable: Deliverable | Status (dated log) | Next steps | Notes (usually
  merged across a project) | Internal PIC. Mapped as:
  - **Text deliverables** — `projects/{id}.wipDeliverables` [{id, text, status: [status lines],
    next}], no owner/deadline, never tasks, never on Board/Timeline (`wipDeliverableRowHtml`,
    "+ Deliverable" on an entry with no open tasks, "+ Status" / "+ Next step" while empty). Each
    has the same tinted status band as a task: `wipStatusBandHtml(key, list)` is shared, keyed by
    a task id or `"d:<deliverable id>"`, and `wipSaveEdit`/remove branch on that prefix. "+ Add
    entry"'s second box creates the first deliverable. Real projects keep tasks as deliverables
    (status band + checklist steps as next steps) — offered as a "+ Deliverable opens the task
    window" option and declined for leads, since leads often have no owner or date yet.
  - **Notes** — `wipNote`, one per project like the sheet's merged Notes column, multi-line
    (textarea, Shift+Enter for a new line), click to edit. Shown when set; "+ Notes" sits on the
    info line for entries with no tasks or in an owner category, and in the ⋯ row for a busy
    active project (a "+ Notes" line under every project would be clutter).
  - **Owner** — `wipOwner`, a roster name, the sheet's "Internal PIC", only for Pitches, Hot
    leads, Cold leads and Closing reports (`WIP_OWNER_CATEGORIES`, asked for by name); Active
    jobs/Content marketing have owners on every task. Picked from roster pills (not a `<select>`,
    which a live re-render would snap shut). Not counted in workload.
  - Header count reads "N deliverables" for an entry with text deliverables and no tasks, never
    "0 open". Deliverable/status/note/owner edits are not logged to Activity (only adding an entry
    and changing category are); task status is, since tasks are.
- **Collapse all / Expand all** in the By project section header (`data-wip-fold-all`,
  `wipProjectNamesShown`) folds or opens every project; it reads "Expand all" once all are folded.

Agenda mode — three sections, and the shape of them is where the design work is:

- **Needs a decision** — overdue, crunch days, a deadline landing while its owner is away, a
  project its own task dates say it will miss, work stuck in review, and **Behind** — a task that
  isn't overdue yet but has an overdue checklist step (one row per task, oldest late step named;
  skipped for tasks already in the Overdue roll-up). Catches a slip before the task's own deadline. **One flat list with a
  chip for the kind, not five labelled sub-lists**: they are all "somebody has to say something
  about this", and five headers over lists that are usually one row long is most of a screen
  spent on scaffolding. Rows that stand for exactly one task carry `data-open-task` and ride the
  existing document-level delegation; roll-ups have nothing single to open and are plain `div`s.
- **The next N days** — the chronological spine. One row per day that has anything on it, empty
  days skipped entirely. Project deadlines and task deadlines share a day's row, because in the
  meeting they are the same question. **Dated open checklist steps are on it too**, under the day's tasks with a grey
  step diamond, the step's owner (falling back to the task owner) and "Step in <task> · <project>".
  Added so the Suits team could trial running WIP off checklist steps (their sheet's "Next steps"
  column) — before this, steps only appeared as timeline diamonds and were missing from the agenda.
- **Away** — one row per leave *period* overlapping the window, including periods that started
  before today and run into it.

Three things it deliberately does NOT do, each of which is the obvious version of itself:

- **Overdue rolls up per PERSON, not per task.** The meeting question is "where are you at?"
  asked of someone; fifteen late tasks listed individually would push everything else below the
  fold.
- **Leave is not drawn on the spine**, even though it is a date. A two-week absence would stamp
  the same name onto fourteen consecutive rows and drown the deadlines those rows exist to show.
  It is listed once, as a period. The only place leave meets a specific day is when it collides
  with a deadline — and that is an alert, not a calendar entry. Same reasoning keeps overdue out
  of the spine (which is forward-looking), so nothing is printed twice.
- **"Project has open tasks" is not the at-risk test.** Every live project has open tasks, so
  that fires on all of them every week, which is the same as firing on none. The test is whether
  the project's own task dates already contradict its deadline: a task that is late, one dated
  past the project date, or one with no date at all to schedule against. An on-track project
  says nothing here and keeps its date on the spine below.

**Scoping goes two ways on purpose**, and this is the part most likely to be "fixed" by mistake:

- It **ignores the teamspace switcher entirely** (changed on request, 2026-10-05): Suits runs one
  company-wide WIP on one shared screen, so everyone sees the same projects, alerts, agenda, leave
  and timeline whichever teamspace they have picked. The context line reads "all teams". It used to
  respect the switcher (on the reasoning that a Production-only WIP was a real use), and before
  that the Away list alone was unscoped after it hid the leave of people whose tasks were on screen.
  If per-team WIP is ever wanted again, it should be an explicit control on this view, not the
  sidebar switcher silently changing a shared meeting screen.
- It **ignores the search/priority/project/assignee filter bar**, and hides the toolbar outright
  (`TOOLBAR_FULLY_HIDDEN_VIEWS`). Those filters persist across sessions by design, so a narrowing
  somebody left set last Tuesday would silently delete items from a meeting agenda with nothing
  on screen to say so. A hidden filter is survivable on a board you are scanning; it is not
  survivable on the list you are using to decide what the company works on next. **Do not
  "unify" this by routing the view through `applyFilters`.**

The window is 1 / 2 / 4 weeks, persisted to `flowboard_wip_range`, inclusive at both ends (a
7-day window is today plus the next six). Overdue is **never** windowed — late is late.

**Timeline (a fourth, full-width section under the three above).** The Gantt cropped to the
meeting window, requested so the room can see task spans and not only deadline days.
`wipTimelineHtml` draws one bar per open task that *overlaps* the window (not only those inside
it), clamped to the edges, sorted by start date. It is **not `renderGantt()` and must not be
routed through it**: that reads `applyFilters` (same stale-filter hazard as above) and is built for
the full range with a frozen label column and sideways scroll. This one is a single percentage-width
grid (`minmax(0,1fr)` columns) that fits the card at 7/14/28 days, so it never scrolls. It reuses
the Gantt's bar colours, status-stage fill, overdue dot, `.gantt-leave` bands and `data-open-task`,
so the two views cannot disagree about how a task looks. Open tasks with no start date or deadline
are counted in a footnote rather than silently missing. The header carries a legend (same
swatches as the Timeline tab) that lists **only what is drawn** — priorities present, Ready for
review, Overdue dot, Away hatch — so a quiet week doesn't print keys for things that aren't there.
A month row sits above the day numbers (one cell per month in the window, full name when it spans
6+ columns, short otherwise) — a 4-week window always crosses a month boundary and bare day
numbers stop being unambiguous. Deliberately omitted: the frozen Progress
column, stacked-deadline badge and today line (today is the left edge by definition).

**People show as avatars on the Timeline tab, but as written names on WIP Meeting** — a deliberate exception to the Timeline-to-WIP rule: WIP is read together on a shared screen where nobody can hover, and initials-only avatars can be ambiguous. `ganttItemLabelHtml(t, item, asNames)`; WIP passes `true`. Originally shipped as avatars on both (`ganttAvatarHtml`: Google photo or coloured initials, full name in the hover tooltip) — the task line is avatar + task name, and checklist rows show the item assignee's avatar before the date. Asked for directly: the names "just add more text to read".

**The label column matches the Timeline tab's** (asked for directly: "can the timeline
functionality match between WIP and Timeline page? ... adjustable column width, project name and
task contrast"). Same label markup (text-sm project with hover tooltip, owner/task line at
`text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` — WIP's original shade, which was then preferred over the
Timeline's `dark:text-white` and applied to both), and the **same width variable**: `GANTT_LABEL_WIDTH`, persisted under
`flowboard_gantt_label_width`, so dragging `#wip-resize-handle` resizes the Timeline tab's Task
column too, and vice versa. Applied through a `--wip-label-w` CSS variable on `#wip-timeline-grid` so
a drag moves every row without re-rendering. **Not `#wip-timeline`** — that id is already the
section's outer container in the markup; the first version reused it, `getElementById` found the
outer one, and the variable set there was shadowed by the inner element's own inline value, so
the drag silently did nothing (reported as "WIP adjustable width is not working"). Capped at 45% of the card (`wipLabelWidthCss`),
because this chart never scrolls sideways and a wide label column would squeeze the day columns.
The stale "Fill: checklist done…" legend entry was removed at the same time — bars have no fill.

**Not a stored event record.** There is no `events` collection, no create/edit/delete UI, and
nothing in Firestore for this feature at all — WIP is a standing meeting whose content is
entirely derived from tasks, projects and leave, so there is nothing to save and nothing to keep
current. A second event becomes one more nav item under the same header. That is also why
**Superseded (2026-10-06): every group is labelled now, and "Events" became "Meetings"** (see
"Sidebar groups"). Original reasoning: **Events is the rail's one written label**: the other groups are loose sets of views separated by
dividers, this one is a named category meant to grow. The header carries `.sidebar-label`, so it
disappears with the dividers when the rail collapses to icons (that rule positions it absolute,
so it costs no height and no flex gap either — verified, not assumed).

`personInTeamspace` was **completed** as part of this. It already existed in a narrower form that
answered neither `'all'` nor `'unassigned'`: its only caller (`renderPeople`) checked `'all'`
itself before calling, and nothing had yet asked it about `'unassigned'` — which it got wrong,
since that is not a department key, so `indexOf` found it in nobody's list and the Unassigned
teamspace listed no roster members at all. That is the one teamspace where people with no
department are the entire point.

### Monday Meeting (weekly updates)

Replaces the "MMM Pulse-board" Google Sheet's monthly person x week tabs, where everyone typed
their week into a cell before the Monday meeting. Asked: "Is there a way to integrate this?", then
"as painless as possible to fill ... organised and easy to read and go through".

- **Its own page under Meetings, listed first above WIP** (`view-weekly`, sidebar "Monday Meeting"), NOT a mode on People.
  It was built as a Workload | This week switch on People first and moved before shipping: "I like
  how People page works and looks now. Will it affect the usability...?" A switch would add a
  control to a page people like and make its toolbar appear and disappear by mode. **Don't fold it
  back into People.**
- **Filling it in is one tap per project.** `openWeeklyEditor` lists your open projects from the
  board (tasks you own or are involved in, plus checklist steps assigned to you, via
  `weeklyBoardProjects`), each with six statuses: On track, Waiting on client, Waiting on us
  (added on request), On hold (added on request: paused, nobody needs to act), Needs help, Done.
  Six is the cap: more slows every row every week. Other candidates were already covered (Blocked =
  Needs help, In review = a Waiting, Behind = derived from dates). A note is optional; picking Needs help focuses it.
  "Same as last week", "Mark the rest On track", "I'm on leave this week" and one line for things
  not on the board (admin, new biz). Unanswered projects are simply left out.
- **Each project row shows what to reference** (asked: "it's hard to reference the latest status"):
  "Latest:" = the newest WIP status line on any of the project's open tasks (`weeklyLatestStatus`,
  with date and first name) plus "Use this" to copy it into the note; "Coming up:" = your next
  three dated tasks/steps there. Muted, and only when there's something to show.
- **Reading it:** Needs help from everyone first, then one card per person grouped by department
  (like the sheet's blocks; **Admin always last**, after people with no department, and someone in
  Suits + Admin sits with Suits: `weeklyGroupDept`/`weeklyDeptRank`), rows always in the order needs help, waiting on us, waiting on
  client, on track, on hold, done, with the next date in a fixed right column. NEW marks a row that
  differs from that person's previous week (nothing is marked if there was no previous update).
  A person with no update shows "Not in yet" plus what's due for them this week from the board;
  someone whose booked leave covers the whole Mon-Fri week shows "Away this week" and doesn't count as waiting
  (a day or two off still expects an update; see "Features in sync"). The two chips look deliberately
  different (reported as "almost the same" when both were amber): Away is amber, the app-wide
  "not available" colour; Not in yet is a dashed neutral outline with a clock. That due list shows
  everything (a "+N more" cap shipped first; asked: "just show all?"); a task and its own step with
  the same name and date are listed once. Below `sm` the status
  label takes its own line so the text keeps the card's width.
- **Present mode was built and removed before shipping** ("Present mode is not necessary").
- **Company-wide, ignores the teamspace switcher**, same reasoning as WIP: one shared meeting.
  Expected people = roster accounts seen in the last `WEEKLY_ACTIVE_DAYS` (45), or who already
  wrote one for that week. Hand-typed assignee names can't sign in, so they aren't expected.
- **Which week:** `weeklyCurrentKey` is the Monday of the meeting the update is FOR. Mon-Thu = this
  Monday; from Friday it looks ahead to next Monday, so the Friday reminder and weekend edits land
  on the right meeting. Editable all week (decided); a save after 10am on the meeting Monday shows
  "Edited <time>" instead of "Updated".
- **Stored on the person's OWN roster doc**, `people/{uid}.weekly` = `[{week, rows: [{project,
  status, note}], extra, leave, at, editedAt?}]`, newest first, last `WEEKLY_KEEP` (26) weeks.
  Same place as `chatLastRead`/`toursSeen`, so **no rules change**: team-readable, only you can
  write yours. Rows key on the project NAME, so renaming a project breaks NEW for that row once.
- **Reminders** (`checkWeeklyReminder`, on the people snapshot and every 10 min): Friday from 4pm
  (and the weekend), then Monday 9am-6pm only if still missing (neither if away the whole week). An in-app
  notification to yourself, `type: 'weekly_reminder'` ("Your Monday update is due"); clicking it
  opens the page and your editor. Slots sent are recorded in `people/{uid}.weeklyReminded` so a
  reload or second tab doesn't resend. Client-side like every automation here: it fires the next
  time your app is open after those times.
- **Not done (offered, deferred):** writing a note through to the WIP task status line. Rows are
  per project and WIP status is per task, so it needs a rule for which task gets it.
- **The sheet:** one Monday running both, then retire it (decided). That is a team step, not code.
- **To switch off:** `WEEKLY_ENABLED = false` in the WEEKLY UPDATE section removes the sidebar item
  and all wiring. Saved `weekly` fields stay on people docs harmlessly.
- Verified in Chromium against the real page with an in-memory Firestore stand-in (47 checks:
  filling, saving to your own doc only, editing, NEW, edited mark, week navigation, teamspace
  ignored, Friday/Monday reminders and no duplicate, bell click-through, page tour, People
  unchanged, no sideways scroll at 390px, light and dark).

### Calendar v2: what's on which day (supersedes the section below while switched on)

Asked "calendar seems redundant", then "what can make it better so that it is usable?", then a mockup, then
"build it". The old Calendar drew task **spans**, a weaker copy of Timeline. v2 draws **moments**, so the two
pages answer different questions: Timeline = how long work takes; Calendar = what lands on which day.

- **What it lists per day:** task deadlines, checklist step due dates (step assignee, else task owner), dates
  from briefs that are **not** already a checklist step (client feedback, show day; a brief date that matches
  a step name in that project is shown once, as the step), project deadlines, and who's away. Ordered brief
  → project → deadline → step → away; late first, done last (faded, struck through).
- **Opens on the next seven days from today** (`cal2WeekStart`), Month view one click away
  (`flowboard_calendar_view`, Monday-first grid). Arrows move a week or a month; Today resets both.
- **Late work is carried onto today's column** (`carryLate`) with "LATE · was due …". A week that starts today
  would otherwise drop everything overdue. Shipped without it first; the screenshot showed a late step missing.
- **Coloured by kind, not priority:** deadline = brand, step = indigo, from a brief = cyan, project deadline =
  violet, away = amber (light-mode amber floor respected). Project names use `projectNameHtml`, so client tags
  are coloured here too (the approved mockup showed them).
- **Respects** the Mine/Everyone toggle (Mine = dates where you are the person named; project deadlines and brief
  dates only for projects you have work in), the toolbar filters and the teamspace (tasks via `applyFilters`).
- **Clicks:** a task deadline or step opens the task; a brief date opens the Brief card; a day header opens the
  existing day pop-up with the full list.
- **Reads only.** Nothing is saved, so switching it off cannot affect data.
- **To switch back:** `CALENDAR_V2_ENABLED = false` in the "CALENDAR V2" section. `renderCalendar` then runs the
  original code below, untouched, and the arrows/Today return to it (v2 takes them over with capture-phase
  listeners only while on). Or `git revert` the commit titled "Calendar v2".
- Verified in Chromium against the real page with stand-in data (21 checks, plus the switched-off run).

### Calendar view

Rebuilt from a plain read-only month grid (dot + task name on the deadline day only, static
"+N more" text) into something meant to replace checking a personal Google Calendar for
deadlines. The goal was stated directly and then deliberately narrowed by a follow-up question:
"I want users to use this tool rather than google calendar... a full replacement" turned into
"just task/project deadlines" once asked whether that meant deadline-tracking or real meeting
scheduling (invites/RSVPs/time-of-day booking) — this app has no concept of a meeting or an
invite system, and building one would be a fundamentally different, much larger feature than
polishing an existing deadline grid. Four gaps, all requested together in one list:

- **"Mine"/"Everyone" scope, defaulting to Everyone** (it defaulted to Mine until 2026-10-06; changed on request, and a stored Mine choice is kept) (`calendarScope`, `CALENDAR_SCOPE_KEY =
  'flowboard_calendar_scope'` in `localStorage`) — the single biggest thing making this read as
  *your* calendar rather than a shared project grid. `#calendar-scope-mine`/`#calendar-scope-all`
  are a small segmented control (`.calendar-scope-btn.active`, same on/off shape as
  `.view-toggle-btn.active` but its own rule since it's a two-button track, not a full-width rail
  item), filtering on `t.assignee === myName` before anything else runs. Falls back to "everyone"
  silently if there's no signed-in name to match (shouldn't happen in practice — the auth gate
  blocks reaching this view at all without one).
- **Every task now spans its whole `startDate` → `deadline` range on the grid, not just a dot on
  the deadline day** ("like the Gantt already does," said directly once the scope question above
  was settled). `renderCalendar` builds `calendarDayCache` once per render — for each task, walk
  every day from `start` to `end` (clamped to the visible 42-day grid) and push an
  `{task, isStart, isEnd}` entry. A day's chips render as a small colored bar (`pm.bar` + white
  text on the deadline day, `pm.barLight` + normal text on in-progress days — the same two shades
  the Gantt already uses for its own bars, reused rather than inventing a third color language)
  instead of the old dot-and-name row.
  - **The task name only re-appears at the true start, the true end, or the first column of a new
    week the span is still running through** (`isStart || isEnd || isRowStart`) — not on every
    day of the span. A task running the whole width of a row would otherwise repeat its own name
    seven times in a row, which reads as clutter, not a calendar; Google Calendar's own multi-day
    event bars re-label the same way at each week boundary.
  - **Legacy tasks with no `startDate` fall back to the old single-day-on-the-deadline behavior**
    (`parseDate(t.startDate) || parseDate(t.deadline)`) rather than guessing a start. A task whose
    `startDate` is somehow after its own `deadline` (bad data) defensively collapses to a single
    day on the deadline instead of rendering an inverted range.
  - **A day's entries sort deadline-first, then by `PRIORITY_WEIGHT`** — arriving today is more
    actionable than merely being in progress, so it should be the first thing a crowded day shows
    before the cap (`CALENDAR_DAY_CAP = 3`) pushes anything into overflow.
- **Who's on leave shows directly on the grid** (`isOnLeave`, unchanged — see "Personal leave"
  above) — a small amber line per day cell naming who's away, independent of the Mine/Everyone
  toggle since it's team-wide context, not a personal task. First place this data renders
  day-by-day rather than only as a Gantt range-band or a `leave_clash` warning.
- **The old static "+N more" is now `openCalendarDayModal`, a real day-detail popover**
  (`#calendar-day-modal`) — a busy day used to just hide everything past the third task with no
  way to see the rest. Clicking either the day number (works even with zero overflow — a day with
  exactly three tasks had no click target at all before) or the "+N more" row opens it, reading
  straight from `calendarDayCache` rather than recomputing spans. Its list reuses the same
  `data-open-task` attribute the rest of the app already delegates clicks on
  (`document`-level listener, see "GLOBAL CLICK DELEGATION"), plus one extra listener scoped to
  `#calendar-day-modal-list` that closes the popover itself the moment a task inside it is
  clicked — both listeners see the same click; the scoped one runs first during the bubble phase,
  so the day modal is gone before the task modal appears instead of sitting stacked behind it.
  Escape and an outside-the-card click both close it, wired into the same keydown handler and
  `modal-backdrop` idiom every other modal in this app already uses.
- **Verified without live Firestore data**: the DOM/interaction layer (scope toggle persistence,
  day modal open/close via a real click/Escape/backdrop-click, the empty-day message) was checked
  against the real file via Playwright; the span-building algorithm itself (multi-week spans,
  legacy no-`startDate` fallback, the bad-data collapse, deadline-first sort) was verified with an
  isolated Node port of `renderCalendar`'s `calendarDayCache`-building logic, run against
  synthetic tasks — the same two-track approach used earlier in this file for the workload/
  deadline/review/leave automations, since there's still no Firebase emulator in this environment.

### Who can edit what (ownership rules)

> **Current state (supersedes the creator/assignee/admin history below):** `tasks` `update` is open
> to every `@mediashock.com.sg` account, on request ("anyone can edit the whole task but it still
> gets recorded in activity"). Accountability is the append-only `activity` log (`task_updated`,
> `task_moved`, ...), which is written by the browser, so it is not tamper-proof. `delete` is still
> creator-or-admin (anyone can archive). The table and carve-out notes below describe the earlier
> model and are kept for the reasoning.

**Also involved (`involved` on a task).** One accountable `assignee` stays the single owner;
`involved` is an optional array of display names for people who work on it too. Modelled on
Jira/Linear (owner + watchers) rather than ClickUp/Monday multi-assignee, which would force a
workload Split-vs-Sum decision and touch every alert. Involved people get comment notifications and
an "added you to" notification (`type: 'involved'`), and show as avatars on the Board card. They do
NOT count toward workload or the deadline/stack/leave alerts — but they DO put the task and its
project in their teamspace (`taskTeamspacePeople`, used by both `taskInTeamspace` and
`projectDepartments`). The
assignee is stripped from the list at save. **Picking a new owner from the involved list swaps
them**: the old owner takes the new owner's chip (`swapOwnerIntoInvolved`, on the assignee
`change`), so the old owner keeps comment updates instead of dropping off, and swapping back
restores the original lineup. **Picking an owner who was *not* involved now keeps the old owner
too** — added as an involved chip the moment the owner changes, so a clean handoff is one `×`
away. It used to drop them, which also dropped the project out of their teamspace (see
`projectDepartments`). Only people on the task *as saved* (`involvedOriginalPeople`) are kept,
so clicking through the dropdown doesn't leave a trail of people who were only selected for a
moment. The old owner gets an "added you to" notification on save, like anyone newly involved
(none if you hand off your own task — you never notify yourself). Hidden behind `+ Also involved` in the task modal.
Round-trips through Import/Export. No rules change was needed.

**Checklist items can be assigned (`item.assignee` on a checklist item).** Asked for as
"checklist to be able to assign people. If not under [people] the tasks would not register."
Optional display name, picked from the roster (`checklistAssigneeSelectHtml`) inside the item's
existing pencil editor — **not** on the add row, which already carries text/link/date/TBD/Calendar.
Off-roster current values stay selectable, same rule as the owner picker.
- **Deliberately light — a step, not a half-task.** Agreed after discussing it: an assigned item
  is visible and notified, but does **not** count toward workload, People-card sort order, WIP,
  Focus, or deadline/leave alerts. If it is big enough to need those, it should be its own task.
  Hold this line; "why don't checklist items count toward X" is the predictable next request,
  and answering it item-by-item rebuilds tasks inside tasks.
- **People view**: a person's card lists open items assigned to them on *other people's* tasks
  under "Checklist items on others' tasks", and the count line reads "N active · M checklist".
  Their own task's items aren't repeated (the task row covers them); done items and items on Done
  tasks are hidden. A person whose only work is a step still gets a card. Items are not
  teamspace-scoped per item — the card is the person's — but project/priority filters apply.
- **Notifications** (`notifyChecklistChanges`, compared by item id against the saved task, so
  re-saving or reordering never re-sends): `checklist_assigned` to the assignee when an open item
  is newly given to them; `checklist_done` to the task owner when an item assigned to someone
  else is ticked. Self-actions never notify.
- **Teamspace**: an item assignee puts the project in their department, like "Also involved"
  (`projectDepartments`).
- **Not built, on purpose (recommended against for now)**: ticking a step from the People card
  (opening the task is one click); auto-adding item assignees to "Also involved" (they'd get every
  comment on the whole task).
- Verified by extracting the real functions into a Node harness (21 checks: notification
  transitions, picker, import, project departments, People-card rendering). No emulator in this
  environment, so the modal editor itself has not been clicked through.

**Adding several items at once, and grouping by due date (2026-10-07).** Asked: "Should checklist
items be allowed to be entered using multiple lines ... to perhaps group the items together that are
due on the same day same time?" (six ad sizes due together). **Decided: keep one item per thing, not
one multi-line item** — a merged item can't be ticked, dated, assigned or time-tracked per size,
draws one Timeline diamond instead of six, and hides a late size inside the batch. Built instead:
- **`#task-checklist-input` is a textarea.** Enter adds; Shift+Enter or a pasted list adds one item
  per line (`checklistLinesFromInput`: blank lines skipped, "- " / "• " / "1. " markers stripped,
  50 max), all taking the row's date/TBD/link. "Calendar" opens one event for the batch, never one
  tab per item. It grows to about 6 lines (`autosizeChecklistInput`).
- **Open items group under a heading per due date** (`checklistIsGrouped`, `checklistGroupKey`,
  `checklistGroupHeadHtml`): dates in order, then Due TBD, then No date, with a count when 2+.
  **Only once a date is shared by 2+ open items**; a milestone list where every item has its own
  date stays a flat list with each row's own "Due" line (otherwise a heading over every row). Rows in a group
  drop their own "Due …" line; the heading carries it, rose when overdue, amber when after the task
  deadline. Items keep their own order inside a group. The folded "N done" rows are not grouped.
- **A group whose 2+ steps all have the same people names them once on the heading** (avatars + name
  after the date and count; `checklistGroupHeadHtml(key, members, people)`), and those rows drop
  their own people line. Asked "if same name, can group together?" from six ad sizes each
  repeating "Aqila Ramadhani". Mixed groups keep a name per row; a step being edited shows its
  people in the editor as usual.
- **Dragging an item into another date's group gives it that date** (in the drop handler);
  otherwise it would jump straight back to its old group. A toast always says so ("... is now due
  Oct 9"), so a drag meant only to reorder never changes a date silently.
- **The Add button says "Add 6"** once the box holds several lines, so a paragraph pasted by
  mistake shows what it would do before it's done.
- The last three were found by a usability check the owner had to ask for before pushing ("I
  should not need to remind"): run that check before proposing any UI change.
- Verified in Chromium, light and dark, and at phone width (12 checks: Add N label, Shift+Enter,
  no headings for one dated item or all-different dates, the box growing and shrinking, the drag toast,
  bullet stripping, 7 items saved, headings and counts, no repeated Due lines, drag taking the
  date, saved dates). The task-window and desktop suites still pass.

**Several people per step, and time logged for each of them (2026-10-07).** Asked: "can assigning
members be included and when time is allocated to that checklist item (briefing), can the time be
tracked automatically for each member included? So this adds to the total time spent for the
project as well." Two decisions made with the user: **person-hours** (3 people at a 1h briefing =
3h on the project) and **one person can log for everyone on the step**.
- **Data:** `item.assignees` (array). `item.assignee` is still written as the first person, so any
  reader that only looks at that field keeps working. Always read through `stepPeople(it)` (falls
  back to the old single field) and write through `setStepPeople(it, names)`; `stepPeopleLabel(it)`
  gives one full name or several first names. Every reader listed above (teamspace, People view,
  notifications, Calendar v2 Mine, Monday board projects, WIP steps, Timeline labels, brief sync,
  import, the phone layout) goes through these.
- **Editor:** the step's pencil editor has a "People" row of chips with an x, plus a dashed
  "+ Add" select (the old single select is gone). Adding/removing redraws only that row and puts
  focus back on "+ Add", because the editor saves and closes when focus leaves it.
- **Time:** when Time Tracking's note matches a step with people, a "For" row (`#task-time-people`,
  `syncTimePeople`) appears with those people ticked, a "+ Add" for anyone else, and "1h each · 3h
  total". Logging saves **one entry per ticked person**: `author` = who the time is for, `loggedBy`
  = who entered it when that's someone else (shown in the avatar's tooltip in the log). Nobody
  ticked logs for you. Project, task and billable totals already summed every entry, so nothing
  else had to change for the hours to count.
- **Entries logged together are ONE row** (`timeEntryGroups`), asked: "If multiple people are
  involved in briefing, then should time tracking reflect it?". Grouped by identical `date`
  timestamp + minutes + note + step + billable + overtime; stored data is unchanged (still one
  entry per person). The row: stacked avatars in a fixed `w-10` slot (so the duration column lines
  up), the per-person duration, and "3 people · 3h" before the date; everyone named on hover.
  - **Editing a row edits the group**: the "For" row appears with the row's people ticked, plus
    the step's people unticked. Ticking adds an entry for that person with the row's original
    timestamp (so it stays one row, `loggedBy` = you); unticking removes theirs; nobody ticked
    leaves the people as they were. This is how an entry from before steps had people gains them.
  - **Removing a group confirms with the count** ("Remove this time for all 3 people?") and says
    how to remove one person instead.
  - Never grouped: entries with no `date` (old imports), and a second entry for someone already
    in the group (an edit keeps one entry per person, so grouping them would merge their time).
  - **Old single entries are NOT converted automatically** (asked "can all past entries be updated
    to the new UI?"): nothing records who else was there, and adding people would add hours
    nobody logged. They show in the new layout as a group of one; the pencil adds people.
- **People can be set on the add row too** (`#task-checklist-people-btn`, `checklistAddPeople`),
  asked once several items could be added at once ("add people in checklist is not done here?").
  **One fixed-size button, not a chip per person**: chips (the first version) grew with every name,
  squeezed the text box and pushed Calendar and Add onto a second line ("adding more people just
  disrupts the UI"). The button reads "+ People", or up to three overlapping avatars plus "+N",
  with everyone named on hover. It opens `#checklist-people-pop`, a team list with checkboxes and
  a search box, on `<body>` and `position: fixed` from the button (the task form scrolls and
  would clip it), z-60 over the modal, flipping upward when there's no room below. Ticks apply
  live; outside click, scrolling or Escape closes it (Escape caught in the capture phase so the
  task window stays open). Applied to every item added in that go, cleared after, like the date.
  The item editor's People row keeps chips: it has a line of its own. The text box placeholder
  is "Add checklist items…" (the longer one was cut off); "Add N" and the tooltip explain the rest.
- **One notification per person per save** (`notifyChecklistChanges` groups by recipient):
  `snippet` = "6 items: A, B, …" and a `count` field, which the bell, the phone list and the
  desktop popup read through `checklistCountWords` ("assigned you 6 checklist items on …").
  Found by checking the add-row change before building it: six ad sizes for one person would
  otherwise have sent six notifications.
- **Still a step, not a half-task:** the people are notified and see it on their People card, but
  it doesn't count toward workload, Focus or alerts, same line as before.
- **Bug fixed on the way:** `openTaskModal` handed the task window the live task's own checklist
  item objects, so edits changed the "before" list too and `notifyChecklistChanges` compared a
  list with itself. "Assigned you a checklist item" and "finished a checklist item" had never been
  sent from the task window. It now works on copies.
- Verified in Chromium against the real page with the in-memory stand-in (20 checks: old single
  person still shown, add/remove people without the editor closing, the For row and its totals,
  one entry per person with `loggedBy`, a plain note logs once for you, saved data shape,
  notifications to both new people, the project card showing 3h 30m, People view). The desktop
  and phone suites still pass.

**Helpers: three rule-based nudges (2026-10-07).** Asked "what can I build agents for in PM?",
then "Build the rule-based helpers". The `HELPERS` section in index.html (`HELPERS = {handoff,
time, dates}`, each switchable). All client-side like the automations above, each worked out in
the browser of the person it's for. Held to "the tool must not add work" (see the standing rule).
- **"You're up" handoff** (`step_up`, in `notifyChecklistChanges`): ticking a step tells the
  people on the next open step. "Next" is the step below on screen: by due date when the list is
  grouped, else list order (`checklistHandoffOrder`). Not sent to whoever ticked it, nor to
  someone just added to that step (they get "assigned you"). A task owner who is also next gets
  this instead of "finished a checklist item". Works from the task window and the phone.
- **Friday time reminder** (`time_nudge`, `checkFridayHelpers`, Friday from 3pm or the weekend):
  tasks you're on (owner, involved, or on a step) that you edited, moved, ticked a step on or
  posted a status line on this week, with no time logged by you this week. A comment alone, a
  created task, or someone else's task doesn't count. One notification, recorded in your own
  `people/{uid}.helpersSent` so it isn't resent; skipped while you're on leave.
- **Missing dates** (`dates_missing`, `checkMissingDates`, in `runTaskAutomations`): your In
  Progress tasks over 3 days old with no start date or deadline (so not on the Timeline). Once per
  task ever (`notificationDedup.missingDatesFor`), so a deadline left TBD on purpose is nudged once.
- **Dropped before shipping:** a Friday "add a status line to each task" nudge. It would have added
  a weekly chore per task, duplicating the Monday update.
- Verified in Chromium with the in-memory stand-in and a fixed clock (13 checks: who gets "you're
  up" incl. grouped order and the owner merge, Friday timing, no resend, what counts as work,
  missing dates once and not for new or Pipeline tasks, bell headlines).

**`update` is creator-OR-assignee-OR-admin** — the fourth shape this rule has taken. The board
started fully open (`allow read, write: if isMediashock()`), moved to an ownership-scoped model
once the team grew past five (admin → anything, assignee → their own task, everyone else →
comments/status only), briefly reverted to fully-open `update` on direct request ("allow other
users to edit the task regardless of assignee or admin rights"), then moved to creator-only on a
second, more deliberate request ("tasks can only be edited by the creator. Not a fully open
model. And only admin can edit everything."). That creator-only shape then generated repeated
"Only Calcium Lo / Zenon Kwok Ze Yong or an admin can change this task" save failures — reported
directly, from screenshots of the blocked-save toast — for teammates who were the task's
*assignee* but not its original creator, so `isAssignee()` was added back as a full grant
alongside `isCreator()`, not merely the legacy no-`createdBy` fallback it briefly was. Reads were
never restricted through any of this — everyone has always seen the whole board.

**`delete` stays narrower: creator-or-admin only (with a legacy assignee fallback), not
assignee.** Losing edit access to your own reassigned task was the friction that got fixed here;
letting anyone assigned a task also be able to permanently delete it was not asked for and stays
out of scope — same split the original ownership model drew between "can edit" and "can destroy."

**Why creator exists at all, alongside assignee.** An assignee can be reassigned to someone who
never touched the task, so relying on assignee alone for `delete` would let a brand-new assignee
delete work they didn't create. The creator is a fact about the task that never changes.
`taskData.createdBy` is stamped once, in `commitTaskSave`, only on the `!isEditing` (brand-new
task) branch — from `auth.currentUser.displayName || auth.currentUser.email` — and never touched
again on any subsequent edit, including by an admin.

**Legacy fallback: tasks saved before `createdBy` existed have none.** For `delete` (where
`isAssignee` isn't already a full grant), `firestore.rules`' `isCreator()`-then-`isAssignee()`
fallback (`resource.data.createdBy == null && isAssignee(resource.data)`) treats those tasks
exactly like the original assignee-based model. Export/Import round-trips `createdBy` like any
other field, so it survives a backup/restore (see the import handler's per-task sanitizer) —
dropping it there would silently demote a re-imported task into the legacy bucket.

| | tasks (`update`) | tasks (`delete`) |
|---|---|---|
| **admin** (`admins()` in `firestore.rules`) | anything | anything |
| **creator** | anything | their own task |
| **assignee** (not creator) | anything | comments/status/completedAt/updatedAt only |
| **anyone else** | comments/status/completedAt/updatedAt only | only via archiving (see below) |

- **The comments/status carve-out still matters for everyone who is neither creator nor
  assignee.** The update rule is `isAdmin() || isCreator(...) || isAssignee(...) ||
  changedKeys().hasOnly(['comments', 'status', 'completedAt', 'updatedAt'])`. Without that last
  clause, commenting, `@mentions`, every comment-driven notification, and dragging a card between
  Board columns would break for the rest of the team.
- **`reviewAudience` follows the same general update check** — it's not in the carve-out's field
  list, so changing it requires creator, assignee, or admin (see "Review audience" elsewhere in
  this file for the UI-side reasoning).
- **Archiving is allowed for everyone; a bare, unrecoverable delete is not.** Both are a `delete`
  on `tasks/{id}`, so the rule can't tell them apart by operation — it uses
  `existsAfter(/databases/$(database)/documents/archivedTasks/$(taskId))`, which reports state
  *after* the batch commits. Archive writes both halves in one `writeBatch`, a bare delete
  doesn't. This matters beyond neatness: `archiveCompletedTasks` archives the whole team's Done
  tasks in one atomic batch, and Firestore fails the *entire* batch if a single write is denied,
  so a creator-only archive rule would have broken that button for every non-admin/non-creator.
- **`archivedTasks` still mirrors the creator-then-legacy-assignee pattern on both `update` and
  `delete`**, deliberately not extended to the new assignee-can-update grant — nothing in the app
  ever calls `updateDoc` on `archivedTasks` (restoring is a set-then-delete move, not an update),
  so this match is defensive only and wasn't part of the reported problem.
- **`isAssignee`/`isCreator` both match a display name**, since that's what `tasks.assignee` and
  `tasks.createdBy` hold — a Google display name, with email as fallback for accounts with no
  displayName set. Someone whose Google display name doesn't match either field still can't edit
  their own task; admins can always fix a wrong `people` display name or step in directly.
- **A "Created by X" line shows in the task modal header** (`#task-created-by`, populated in
  `openTaskModal`) whenever `task.createdBy` exists — hidden for a fresh "Add Task" and for
  legacy tasks with no creator recorded, rather than showing a misleading blank name.
- **Admins are a hardcoded email list in the rules, not a `role` field** — a role in a document
  is only as safe as the rule guarding that document. Keep `admins()` identical to the sibling
  Content Hub's copy.
  - **"Allow me to assign admin rights to selected users" was asked for directly, and declined
    in that form** — turning it into a role field the app can write would recreate exactly the
    self-promotion risk this design avoids: a bug in whichever rule guards that field lets
    someone flip their own flag. What shipped instead, after that trade-off was raised and the
    read-only option chosen: an **"Admin" badge on the People tab** (`isAdminName(name)`,
    matched by email against the existing `ADMIN_EMAILS` via the `teamPeople` roster — same
    name-keyed lookup pattern as `personPhotoUrl`/`leaveFor`) so the team can see who's admin at
    a glance, with a hover title explaining that admin status is set in `firestore.rules`, not
    from this app. Adding or removing an admin still means editing `ADMIN_EMAILS` *and*
    `admins()` in `firestore.rules` and redeploying rules (see "Firestore/Storage rules and index
    deploys are separate from shipping the site" in the parent `Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md`) —
    unchanged, no new write path was added anywhere.
- `suggestions` delete is author-or-admin (update stays open — replies are an embedded array,
  so replying *is* an update to someone else's doc). It was open to everyone only because
  `write` covers delete.
- **Client-side, `writeErrorMessage(err, task)`** turns Firestore's bare
  "Missing or insufficient permissions" into a sentence naming the owner — `task.createdBy ||
  task.assignee`, matching the rules file's own creator-then-assignee fallback, so the name shown
  is always whoever the live rule would actually accept. Wired into the task-save and
  move-task-column handlers; the client never pre-emptively disables the task modal based on
  ownership — the form stays fully editable and Firestore's rule is the actual enforcement, with
  this helper only turning a bare denial into a readable one.

### Auth

Google OAuth restricted via `hd` custom param + client-side `isAllowedEmail` check +
Firestore-rules-level `isMediashock()` check (the real boundary — see rules file comments).
`onAuthStateChanged` drives `startListeners`/`stopListeners` and toggles the whole
auth-gate/app-root visibility.

## Daily health check (the current routine, 2026-10-07)

**"Project Manager daily health check"** (`https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01J7fz1tdrA7HHs2nfj2JRQn`,
cron `30 0 * * 1-5` = 8:30am Singapore, Mon-Fri, Sonnet 5.5). Asked: "Constantly run checks as I did
today to make sure everything is tight and functioning as it should be. Keep looking out for ways to
improve the PM tool." Each run: syntax check, `node tests/run.mjs` (or, if it can't install Playwright,
the latest result of the Tests workflow, which also runs at 7am), a review of the last 3 days' commits
against the standing rules at the top of this file, and 1-3 improvement ideas that add no work or
clutter. Report-only: one short push notification in plain language, no code changes, no issues (the
GitHub connector can't create them; see below). Only the push-notification connector is attached.
Implementing anything from a report is a normal interactive request ("fix the first problem from
today's check"). The two older routines below are disabled and point at the pre-move repo addresses.

## Automated UI/UX optimization reviews

**Stale as of 2026-09-16: this routine no longer exists.** A direct lookup against
`trig_01LFPtkH67p4A3HKqjQMrUb2` returns `404 Trigger not found`, and this account currently has
zero scheduled routines registered at all beyond the new one below. Whether it was deleted or
simply expired isn't known — either way, nothing has fired on the schedule below for some time,
which is the actual explanation if this repo's issue tracker looks emptier than the section below
would suggest. Left un-recreated for now (a deliberate call, not an oversight) — the section below
documents what it *used* to do, in case someone wants to bring it back later.

A scheduled cloud routine (`https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01LFPtkH67p4A3HKqjQMrUb2`, cron
`0 1-21/5 * * *`, ~5 runs/day) used to review this repo unattended and open a GitHub issue titled
"UI/UX Optimization Report — <date>" when it finds something concrete — categorized 🔴 Critical /
🟡 Refinement / 🔵 Feature Optimization, citing specific function/line. It skips creating a new
issue if one from the last 24h already exists, and opens nothing at all if it found nothing real.

**Push-notification fallback.** Every run through 2026-08-12 found real things but silently
failed to file them: `gh issue create`/the GitHub tool hit `403 Resource not accessible by
integration` on every single attempt, and the findings were just discarded — worth knowing if
this repo's issue tracker looks suspiciously empty despite the routine "working." The prompt now
tries issue creation first and, if it fails for any reason, pushes a mobile notification with the
same categorized report instead (prefixed with the error) so a real finding is never silently
dropped again. **The root cause isn't fixed by this** — it's a GitHub App permissions gap (`issues:write`
missing on the integration for this repo), fixable only from GitHub's UI. See "Scheduled cloud
routines" in the parent `Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md` for the exact fix — it's the same gap on both
this repo and the sibling Content Hub repo's routine, since both go through the same GitHub App
installation.

**This is report-only by design, not the original "propose then wait for a reply" spec it was
adapted from.** A cron-fired cloud session runs once, unattended, and finishes — it cannot pause
mid-run and wait days for a human to reply "1, 3, 4" the way an interactive chat can. So the
automated run's tools are deliberately restricted to `Bash`/`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` (no `Edit`/
`Write`), and its prompt forbids touching code entirely. **Implementing anything from a report is
always a separate, manually-triggered step**: open the GitHub issue, then ask Claude in a normal
interactive session (e.g. "implement items 1 and 3 from issue #N") — that request, in a real
conversation, is the actual approval gate. Manage/disable the schedule at
`https://claude.ai/code/routines`.

## AI Product Insights (Suggestions tab)

A second scheduled cloud routine, **"Product Evaluator — Suggestions feed"**
(`https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01Tv9Mrrx9eDiaSUQ23PmYkL`, cron `0 9 * * 1`, weekly, Monday
09:00 UTC), acts as a Product Manager/UX strategist over this specific app and produces 3-5
prioritized product suggestions, landing in the Suggestions tab as clearly AI-flagged cards —
never silently mixed in with real teammate posts.

**Why this is human-in-the-loop, not a direct write.** The routine runs unattended with nobody
signed in, and this app has no service-account/admin Firestore credential set up for anything
outside a real browser session — the same infrastructure gap already documented for the
workload-spike/deadline-reminder automations elsewhere in this file. So the routine never touches
Firestore directly; it can only file a GitHub issue (or, if that fails, push a notification — see
below), and nothing lands in the live `suggestions` collection until a signed-in admin reviews it
in the app and clicks Import. This was a deliberate choice over generating a service-account key
for the routine, weighed directly against the alternative: a service account typically bypasses
Firestore security rules entirely, which would have been a materially bigger, riskier change than
this app has taken on anywhere else.

**What the routine does each run** (self-contained prompt, since a cloud session starts with zero
conversation context):
1. Reads this file in full — it's an unusually detailed, real log of "reported directly" user
   pain points and feature history — plus `git log` for what's actively in flight, so it doesn't
   suggest work that collides with something already underway.
2. Runs 2-3 targeted web searches on recent, concrete feature moves from comparable tools
   (Monday.com, TeamGantt, Asana, ClickUp, Linear) — instructed to avoid generic advice.
3. Checks the last 14 days of open `ai-suggestions`-labeled issues and avoids re-posting the same
   idea unless escalating it with new evidence.
4. Outputs a plain-English summary plus a JSON block (schema below) and files it as a GitHub
   issue titled "AI Product Suggestions — `<date>`", labeled `ai-suggestions`.

```
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "SUGG-001",
      "category": "UX Improvement | Feature Addition | Performance | Workflow Automation",
      "title": "Short, catchy headline (Max 8 words)",
      "priority": "High | Medium | Low",
      "context_trigger": "What behavior or competitor feature triggered this.",
      "proposed_solution": "2-3 sentences, naming exact index.html functions/sections.",
      "expected_impact": "Expected metric or UX improvement.",
      "effort_estimate": "Low (1-2 days) | Medium (1-2 weeks) | High (1+ month)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**The same GitHub issue-creation permissions gap documented above for the UI/UX routine applies
here too — same repo, same GitHub App.** If `gh issue create` fails, the routine falls back to a
push notification carrying the same summary and JSON instead of silently dropping the findings,
identical fallback pattern to the UI/UX routine. This is *why* the app-side import flow (below)
supports pasting JSON directly, not just fetching from GitHub — the fallback path still needs
somewhere to land.

**App-side import** (`AI PRODUCT SUGGESTIONS IMPORT` in index.html's module script, Suggestions
view): an admin-only bar above the suggestions list —
- **"Check GitHub for new suggestions"** fetches the latest `ai-suggestions`-labeled issue via
  GitHub's public REST API, called directly from the browser with no token (this repo is public,
  and anonymous reads of a public repo's issues don't need auth — confirmed against the live API
  before relying on it, since a private repo would have made this whole approach a non-starter).
- **"Paste JSON instead"** reveals a textarea for the push-notification fallback case above —
  both entry points funnel through the same `importAiSuggestionsList()` so they can't drift into
  two different suggestion shapes.
- Each suggestion becomes a real `suggestions` doc: `source: 'ai'`, a fixed
  `author: 'AI Product Insights'` (never a real display name, so it can never collide with or be
  mistaken for a teammate's), plus `aiTitle`/`aiCategory`/`aiPriority`/`aiEffort`/
  `aiContextTrigger`/`aiExpectedImpact`/`aiSourceIssue`. `suggestionCardHtml` renders these with a
  sparkle-badge header (`svgIcon('sparkles', ...)`, the same icon this app already uses for the
  "celebrate" toast) instead of a person's avatar, an indigo card border, and category/priority/
  effort as small chips up top — unmistakably not a teammate's post, not just a slightly
  different color. Replies still work normally on an AI card; only the delete boundary is
  different (see rules note below).
  - **Plain-language first, technical detail collapsed — reported directly as "so hard to
    understand" against a card whose primary text was `proposed_solution`** (the routine's own
    build notes: exact `index.html` function/collection names, meant for whoever implements the
    thing, not for someone scanning the feed to prioritize). `s.aiExpectedImpact` (falling back
    to `s.text` if a hand-pasted JSON skipped it) is now the card's main description; a
    **"Show technical details" toggle** (`.suggestion-ai-details-toggle`, delegated in the same
    `#suggestions-list` click handler as the status button, toggling a sibling
    `#ai-details-<suggestionId>` panel's `hidden` class) reveals `aiContextTrigger` ("Why now")
    and the raw `s.text`/`proposed_solution` ("How to build it") underneath, for whoever actually
    picks the suggestion up to build. This is a pure rendering change — it applies to every
    AI-authored suggestion already imported, and to every future one, with no data migration.
  - **The routine's own prompt was also tightened for future runs**, not just the rendering:
    `expected_impact` is now explicitly instructed to read as plain, jargon-free language a
    non-technical reader (a PM skimming the feed) can understand in one line, while
    `proposed_solution` stays free to name exact functions/collections since it's shown collapsed
    now, not up front.
- **Why admin-only**, unlike posting an ordinary suggestion (open to the whole team): this is a
  bulk write of AI-generated content into a shared board, not one person's own idea — a
  meaningfully different action than the normal "suggest a change" box.
- **Dedup**: a new `aiSuggestionImports/{issueNumber}` doc (mirrors `notificationDedup`'s shape)
  records each imported issue so a second click can't double-post; only the GitHub-fetch path
  writes one — a manual paste has no issue number to key on and is the admin's own responsibility
  not to repeat.

**Firestore rules changes — need the usual manual deploy, they don't ship with the site** (see
"Firestore/Storage rules and index deploys are separate from shipping the site" in the parent
`Claude Projects/CLAUDE.md`):
- `suggestions`' `create` rule gained one carve-out: a doc claiming `source == 'ai'` can only be
  created by an admin. Without this, `create` being open to the whole team (unchanged for every
  ordinary suggestion) would let anyone hand-write a doc with that field and have it render with
  the AI badge and fixed author name — impersonating the import flow's output rather than
  actually going through it. `suggestions`' existing author-or-admin delete rule needed no change:
  since `author` is always the fixed string `'AI Product Insights'` on these docs, it can never
  match a real signed-in user's token, so an AI-authored suggestion is already effectively
  admin-only to remove, for free.
- New `aiSuggestionImports/{issueId}`: read open to the team, `create`/`update` admin-only (unlike
  `notificationDedup`'s whole-team write — only an admin can trigger an import in the first place,
  so a non-admin write here could only ever be tampering with the dedup record, not legitimate
  use), delete denied outright.
- `suggestions`' `update` rule gained a second carve-out alongside the reply-collaboration one:
  any update that touches `status` requires `isAdmin()` (`!changedKeys().hasAny(['status']) ||
  isAdmin()`). An update that doesn't touch `status` — posting or removing a reply — is
  completely unaffected and stays open to the whole team, same as always.

**Status label (Open/WIP/Fixed/Unable to Fix) — every suggestion, human-posted or AI-imported
alike.** Requested directly right after the import flow, so a suggestion can be tracked instead
of just sitting in the feed forever with no indication anyone looked at it. First shipped as a
click-to-cycle badge (Open → WIP → Fixed → Open); reported back directly as easier as a dropdown,
plus a request for a fourth state — a suggestion that's been looked at and deliberately rejected,
not just not gotten to yet — in the same message.
- `SUGGESTION_STATUS_META`/`SUGGESTION_STATUS_ORDER` (near `PRIORITY_META`/`DONE_META`, since
  it's the same "small lookup object keyed by a status string, holding badge classes" shape)
  define four states, in the dropdown's option order: `open` (default) → `wip` → `fixed` →
  `unabletofix`. **`fixed` reuses `DONE_META.badge`'s exact emerald classes** — this app already
  has one established meaning for "finished, in a good way" (Board, Gantt, pinned links), so
  Fixed borrows it instead of introducing a second. **`unabletofix` reuses
  `PRIORITY_META.High.badge`'s exact rose classes** — a different badge in a different spot on
  the card than the priority chip (AI cards show both at once), so sharing rose doesn't collide
  the way reusing it *within* the same badge group would.
- **Missing `status` on a suggestion reads as `'open'`** (`SUGGESTION_STATUS_META[s.status] ?
  s.status : 'open'` in `suggestionCardHtml`) — every suggestion posted before this field existed
  needs no migration, same fix-it-forward pattern as the checklist-item-id backfill.
- **Admin-editable via a real `<select class="suggestion-status-select">`, colored with the
  current status's own badge classes so it still reads as a badge at rest; everyone else sees a
  plain read-only `<span>`** — `suggestionCardHtml` only renders the `<select>` when
  `isAdminUser()`, matching the pattern the AI-import bar already uses (hide the affordance
  entirely for someone who can't use it, rather than showing it disabled). The actual boundary is
  the rules carve-out above, not this check — a non-admin genuinely cannot reach the `change`
  handler through the UI at all (no `<select>` to change), but the rule is what would stop a
  bypass. A failed write (denied by the rule, or offline) calls `renderSuggestions()` in the
  `catch` to snap the dropdown back to the real, unchanged value rather than leaving it showing
  whatever the admin picked but that never actually saved.
